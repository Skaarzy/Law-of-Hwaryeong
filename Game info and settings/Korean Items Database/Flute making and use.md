**. Selecting and cutting bamboo**  
For a daegeum, the artisan uses **Ssanggoljuk**, a rare mutant bamboo harvested after it has grown from November until the emergence of new buds the following year. Ssanggoljuk is prized for its **thick walls and narrow bore**, ideal for producing consistent tones. Finding high-quality Ssanggoljuk is extremely rare, comparable to hunting wild ginseng. Only straight, unblemished stalks are chosen, cut to the desired length for the flute.

**2. Initial heating and drying**  
The freshly cut bamboo contains sap and moisture that can destabilize the fibers. It is **lightly heated over a low fire** to remove the raw parts, then stored to dry for **several years**. This process stabilizes the fibers, prevents warping, and ensures the bamboo will produce a reliable sound once the flute is complete.

**3. Preparing the interior**  
A heated iron rod is used to smooth and clean the inside of the bamboo. This ensures the bore is **even and proportional**, which is critical for the flute’s tonal quality. Any roughness or unevenness could affect airflow and pitch, so the artisan carefully rotates the rod and sometimes reheats sections for uniformity. The smell of this process is what flute making workshops are known for

**4. Marking and burning finger holes**  
The exact positions of the blowhole and finger holes are measured and marked. Using **hot metal rods of different diameters**, the artisan burns each hole. Burning rather than drilling or cutting preserves the bamboo’s fibers, preventing splits and maintaining resonance.

**5. Fine-tuning holes**  
After burning, the holes are refined with a chisel or small rounding tool. This step adjusts the pitch and tonal quality of each note. Precision is key—slight variations in hole size or edge smoothness can significantly alter the flute’s sound.

**6. Straightening or bending correction**  
Even Ssanggoljuk can have slight natural curves. The curved section is heated over fire until pliable. Using a **U-shaped wooden board** and a **rounded wooden stick or chisel-like tool**, the artisan gradually straightens the bamboo. Adjustments are done carefully to prevent cracks, often in small increments.

**7. Setting the shape with rope**  
Immediately after straightening, the bamboo is tied with rope and held in place with boards while it cools. This ensures the corrected shape is maintained and prevents the bamboo from springing back into curves.

**8. Tying for durability**  
Additional rope is wrapped around selected sections to prevent cracking over time and to ensure the flute lasts longer.

**9. Testing and fine-tuning**  
Finally, the artisan plays the flute, making minor adjustments to finger holes or edges to achieve **perfect pitch and tonal balance**. Only after this step is the daegeum considered complete.
