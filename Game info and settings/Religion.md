## **Dao Underlies Everything:**
- **Cheonjo** = Political interpretation of Dao (Heavenly order/mandate)
- **Seon Buddhism** = Buddhist interpretation filtered through Dao principles
- **Musok** = Folk/shamanic interpretation of Dao (natural spirits, balance)
- **Jesa** = Ancestral interpretation of Dao (family harmony, continuity)

## **They're All Different Faces of the Same Dao:**
- **Jeong Dynasty** sees Dao as divine political order
- **Orthodox Sects** see Dao as Buddhist enlightenment path
- **Unorthodox Sects** see Dao as raw natural/spiritual forces
- **Clans** see Dao as ancestral wisdom and family balance
