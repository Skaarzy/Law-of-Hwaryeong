- **Literal meaning:** Wooden slips or tablets.
    
- **Historical context:** Used in ancient Korea and China called jiǎndú as writing materials before paper was common. Thin wooden strips tied together as documents.
    
- **In your game:** Mokgan could be **used for short, important notes or decrees**, official messages, or even quick martial technique sketches. Because they’re wooden, they feel **ancient, sturdy, and authoritative** but limited in space—perfect for short, cryptic information


Strips of wood or bamboo vary primarily in length. For bamboo manuscripts, the strips can go from as short as 9 cm to as long as 45 cm. The width is more consistently around 0.6 cm. The writing proceeds vertically, from right to left. Strips were bound together with hemp, silk, or leather and used to make a kind of folding book, called _jiǎncè_ or _jiǎndú_. The binding process usually takes place after the writing, with a few exceptions.
