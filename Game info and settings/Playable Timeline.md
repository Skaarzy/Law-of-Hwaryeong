THE FIRST PART OF IT: About the Jeong Dynasty's struggle after the war and the conflicts of the Royal court, and the ending of it should be the separation of sects and Jeong Dynasty. The Jeong Dynasty suffered more that it led even though the Jeong Dynasty won and didn’t suffer many casualties, it did suffer internally wit Worship Royal date of Heaven emphasizes ancestor veneration, Confucian rites, and Royal divine legitimacy.ense powers they showed in the war, so those officials tried to convince the emperor to inflict new laws and limitations for the sects, and in the end they succeeded in implementing those laws and getting them approved by the emperor, which made the sects and their leaders very furious and in the end caused the separation of the sects and the Jeong Dynasty, which made the sects as well as the Jeong Dynasty vulnerable.
**THE SECOND PART IS:** About the Jeong Dynasty’s struggles with the people and the whole economy and still the problem in the Royal court which leads to the coup and death of the emperor, with the people being on the side of Dong Zhou. And in the middle of that the sects make an alliance and are trying to organize and distance themselves from the Jeong Dynasty, that’s why they don’t help to stop the coup. And the sects also struggled as well because the separation of the Jeong Dynasty meant they needed to supply and take care of their own distribution of food, money, housing, and they had to take care of their people in general. That way they made an alliance. After all of that, near the end there should be a part where the sects in the end help the Jeong Dynasty in exchange for an alliance with the Jeong Dynasty and letting them be independent, which happens, and they remove Dong Zhou from the throne and the actual heir takes his place, which should be the end.
