### **MC Customization Flow**

Before creating the Mc the player chooses the Clan/Family they will start at which determent's their class then the customization :
1. **Child Stage (Creation Phase 1)**
    - Player chooses:
        - Face (from limited couple of options)
        - Hair style & color
        - Body type (height, muscle/fat)
        - Eye color
        - Minor scars & eyebrows
    - Outfit: neutral/clan basicâ€”no class elements yet.
    - Goal: quick, meaningful choices to establish identity without overwhelming the player.

2. **Teen Stage (Creation Phase 2 / Auto-Transition Preview)**
    - Teen MC appears with **child face aged/upscaled**.
    - Player tweaks:
        - Hair style & color
        - Body type adjustments
        - More options for scars & accessories
    - Outfit: subtle clan hints (color accents or symbols), but still mostly neutral.

3. **Adult Stage (Creation Phase 3 / Final Tweaks)**
    - Adult MC shows teen face aged/matured.
    - Player finalizes:
        - Hair style & color (including beard/mustache if applicable)
        - Body adjustments (height, muscle/fat)
        - More options for scars, eyebrows, and accessories
    - Outfit given via the last tutorial quest which updates fully to **the choose clan class design** with optional skins/dyes unlocked later.



The difference will be that the player if the player wants to change character age , height , muscle  it will change the stats of the character which will appear on the same screen(the player will be able to disable this)
