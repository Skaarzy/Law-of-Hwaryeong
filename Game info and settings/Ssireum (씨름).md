### **Traditional Ssireum in the Joseon Era**
During the Jeong dynasty, Ssireum wasn’t just a sport — it was a test of manhood, endurance, and social standing. It was most often held during festivals like **Dano (端午)** or **Chuseok**, when villages gathered for contests, gambling, and communal feasts. Matches weren’t neatly regulated or officiated by formal referees like now; instead, elders or respected men from the village acted as arbiters, and the rules depended on local custom.
The wrestlers competed in an open dirt area or a flattened field near rivers or marketplaces. There was no standardized sandpit — sometimes straw mats or rice sacks were laid out, but most of the time they fought on bare earth. Participants wore only **loincloths (satba)** or short trousers, often oiled or dusted with sand for grip. The crucial element was the **“satba” belt**, a thick cloth strap tied around the waist and thigh, giving each wrestler something to grab and leverage.
A match began with both men crouching and gripping each other’s satba. They locked eyes, then circled slowly, testing balance and grip. Strength alone didn’t decide victory — technique, timing, and the ability to “read” weight shifts mattered most. The instant one opponent’s upper body or knee touched the ground, the other was declared the winner.
The old-style techniques were raw and efficient. Wrestlers used **hip throws (dwitgeoreum)**, **leg sweeps (balddakchigi)**, and **hooking lifts (deodeolchigi)** — all derived from farm labor movements. Farmers were often the most skilled, their balance and leg strength honed by working in the fields. In Jeong era bouts could get brutal. Dislocated shoulders, sprains, and even broken ribs weren’t uncommon, and some regions allowed open slaps, shoves, or forearm strikes to break an opponent’s grip.
Beyond the physical contest, Ssireum had social and symbolic weight. Victors earned prestige — a local champion might be rewarded with **a sack of rice, a gourd of makgeolli**, or, in rare cases, a chance to marry into a wealthier family. The matches were also seen as a test of spirit; a man’s ability to endure and stay composed under pressure reflected moral strength, which was prized in Confucian Joseon society.
Over time, Ssireum became part of seasonal festivals, with songs, drums, and spectators shouting advice and teasing the wrestlers. Despite the roughness, it carried a sense of camaraderie and rural pride — each village backing its champion against others.
