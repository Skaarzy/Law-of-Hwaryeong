During the **Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910)**, the urban centers, especially **Hanyang (modern-day Seoul)**, faced significant challenges related to **water supply** and **sanitation**. The city relied on a **complex system** of **canals**, **streams**, and **drainage channels** for its water needs, but the lack of advanced technology meant that contamination of water was a constant problem.

### **Water Supply and Canal Systems**

The primary source of **drinking water** in the city came from **natural waterways**, including **Cheonggyecheon** (a central stream in Seoul), which was used to carry **clean water** from mountain streams and rivers into the city. This water was accessed by residents for **drinking**, **bathing**, and **washing**. The larger canals, like **Cheonggyecheon**, were essential for both **drinking water** and for **drainage**, but their use for multiple purposes led to contamination. The **smaller drainage channels** were used for carrying **wastewater** from **latrines**, **kitchens**, and **markets**, and these often ran alongside streets or through neighborhoods. These smaller channels would sometimes overflow or spill into the larger canals, mixing **dirty water** with **drinking water**—especially during heavy rain or floods.

### **Contamination Issues**

The dual use of water canals for both **clean water supply** and **waste disposal** caused significant **pollution**. As **wastewater** from **household use**, **public latrines**, and **stormwater runoff** flowed into the same channels, it often led to the contamination of the drinking water. When **flooding** occurred, the **street-level drainage** could become **overloaded**, spilling waste directly into **canals**. This led to waterborne diseases like **cholera** and **dysentery**—serious health risks that were common in urban centers across the world at the time.

### **Methods of Managing Contamination**

Despite the contamination issues, the Joseon government and citizens had some methods for trying to manage and mitigate the effects:

1. **Water Filtration and Boiling**: In the **royal court** and wealthier households, there were efforts to **filter** or **purify** drinking water. Charcoal, **sand**, and **gravel** were used in **filters** to remove debris and impurities. In some cases, boiling water was practiced to reduce the risk of disease. However, these practices were not widespread, and the general population typically drank water directly from the canals or wells, often contaminated.
    
2. **Night Soil Collection**: One of the more effective ways to deal with **human waste** was through a practice called **night soil collection**. Special workers, known as **night soil men**, would collect human waste from **latrines** and **homes** after dark and transport it outside the city for disposal, usually to be used as **fertilizer** in agricultural areas. While this helped prevent waste from accumulating in the city, the practice did not fully prevent contamination of water, especially if **overflow** from **latrines** or **sewage systems** spilled into **canals**.
    
3. **Flood Management and Levees**: To reduce the risk of **pollution** from **flooding**, the Joseon government constructed **levees** and **embankments** around major **rivers** and streams, including the **Han River**. These were designed to keep **floodwaters** from inundating urban areas, preventing the mixing of **sewage and clean water**. In addition, **Cheonggyecheon** and other canals were sometimes **expanded or diverted** to better manage **water flow** during heavy rains, although this was not a foolproof solution.
    
4. **Cultural and Religious Measures**: There was also a cultural belief in the need to keep water **clean**. People in Joseon society held water purity in high regard, and efforts were made to **cover wells**, **protect water sources**, and **reduce waste** near water. Though **religious** and **spiritual beliefs** didn’t directly purify water, **rituals** and **prayers** were sometimes performed to seek protection from **diseases** caused by contaminated water.
    
5. **Public Health Initiatives**: When **disease outbreaks** occurred, the government would sometimes initiate **public health measures** such as **clean-up campaigns**, in which streets and canals would be **cleared of waste** to reduce the risk of further contamination. These efforts were mostly **reactive**, only occurring after a disease had spread.
    

### **Royal Court and Palaces**

The **royal palaces** (like **Gyeongbokgung** and **Changdeokgung**) had more advanced methods for managing water. These included **cisterns** for storing clean water, as well as efforts to **maintain the purity** of water sources close to the palace. **Water inspectors** were employed to ensure that the water supplied to the **royal family** was **free from contamination**. However, these systems were **isolated** to the royal court and did not address the broader urban population's needs.

### **Conclusion**

The **Joseon Dynasty** had some **innovative but imperfect methods** for managing **water contamination**, but **public health issues** related to waterborne diseases were common due to the **overlapping use of water canals** for both drinking water and waste disposal. Efforts like **night soil collection**, **flood management**, and **filtration** helped to some extent, but without modern sanitation or water treatment technology, **contamination** was an ongoing problem. The government’s **reactive** measures, like **clean-up campaigns** during disease outbreaks, were important but ultimately insufficient in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases across the general population.
