- Spoken dialogue: **English** (or Korean if actors are added) with English subtitles.
- Name tags: **Hangul or Hanja only** (no romanization).
    - Hanja for nobles, scholars, officials — formal or elite.
    - Hangul for commoners, soldiers, merchants, wanderers.
- In-world writing (books, diaries, notes, scrolls): visual **Hangul** by default; **Hanja** for royal decrees, ceremonial texts, or bureaucratic/ancient documents.

**Books, Diaries, Notes:**
- First encounter: text is shown in **original script** (Hangul or Hanja).
- The MC “reads aloud” in English — player sees English translation simultaneously.
- After first reading: content is stored in the **journal/library** fully in English for easy rereading.
- Purpose: immersive discovery first, accessible rereads later.

**Martial Arts Manuals & Technique Books:**
- Main text in **Hangul**, key terms (names of moves, principles) in **Hanja**.
- Optional annotations for clarity in English within journal/library.

**Quest Logs & Gameplay-Critical Text:**
- Always English for clarity.
- Visual in-world text serves flavor; no critical info is hidden exclusively in Hangul/Hanja.

**Design Goals & Benefits:**
- **Immersion:** players see authentic period writing and cultural texture.
- **Accessibility:** English ensures comprehension for all players.
- **Consistency:** visual language signals social status, formality, or context (Hanja = formal/ancient; Hangul = personal/common).
- **Optional flavor reading:** players can enjoy the original script if they like, without blocking gameplay or slowing progression.
