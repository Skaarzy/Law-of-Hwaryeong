# Corrupted Clan Beasts - Extended Descriptions

These beasts appears just before the demon war as a consequence of the demonic cultist doing rituals and increasing their power buy making the animals corrupt so they can get rid of clans and ruin their reputation and lower their moral.
## Yu Clan - Jungle/Dense Forest (Hunters)
**Corrupted Korean Red Fox**

- **Size**: Grew to the size of a large wolf through relentless cannibalism, muscles bulging unnaturally beneath matted red fur
- **Distinctive Feature**: Tail violently split into 4 jagged, bloody segments from countless brutal fights - each piece drips constantly with its now infected blood and hangs at unnatural angles
- **Physical Condition**: Fur is patchy and stained dark with dried blood, eyes have turned yellow with corruption, teeth grown longer and sharper from tearing through its own species
- **Behavior**: Obsessively hunts and devours other Korean red foxes, driving them to near extinction in its territory. Now desperately seeks any prey to satisfy its endless hunger
- **Combat Style**: Uses its four torn tail segments as whip-like weapons, each strike spreading disease. Incredibly fast and cunning, sets ambushes using its knowledge of fox behavior and easily avoid arrows and spears.

## Han Clan - Grassland/Small Forests (Coin/Debt Holders)
**Corrupted Large Amur Tiger**

- **Size**: Nearly twice the size of a normal Amur tiger, muscles grotesquely enlarged from constant killing and feeding
- **Battle Damage**: Left eye completely missing with deep claw scars running down that side of its face. Matching side of throat torn open revealing muscle and sinew, yet it still breathes and roars normally
- **Physical Condition**: Chest partially ripped apart from fighting other large predators, ribs occasionally visible through tears in flesh. Orange fur stained permanently dark with blood
- **Behavioral Changes**: Has abandoned normal tiger hunting patterns - now kills everything it encounters regardless of hunger. Leaves trails of carnage through its territory it doesn't hunt for hunger but for the sake of killing.
- **Combat Ferocity**: Fights with complete disregard for its own safety, using its wounds as intimidation. Roar has become a wet, guttural sound that freezes prey with terror
- **Territorial Expansion**: Constantly pushes into new areas, driven by insatiable bloodlust that normal prey can no longer satisfy

## Yang Clan - Dry Savanna/Grasslands (Entertainers)
**Corrupted Korean Wild Boar**

- **Size**: Grown to massive proportions, easily the size of a small horse, with thick muscle layered under increasingly dense hide
- **Distinctive Damage**: Left tusk snapped in half from charging through stone walls and trees, creating a jagged spear-point that causes devastating wounds
- **Physical Adaptation**: Skin has thickened to leather-like consistency - arrows bounce off harmlessly, simple swords and spears cannot penetrate the hide
- **Behavioral State**: Completely berserk, charges at anything that moves regardless of size or threat. Has destroyed entire settlements in its rampages
- **Charging Pattern**: Never stops or turns during a charge, will run through buildings, trees, or off cliffs rather than change direction
- **Environmental Damage**: Its territory is marked by destroyed structures and uprooted trees from its endless charging attacks
- **Combat Threat**: The broken tusk combined with massive momentum makes it capable of punching through stone walls and metal armor

## Song Clan - Swamp Forest/Rocky Mountain (Assassins)
**Corrupted Korean Pit Viper**

- **Size**: Grown to enormous length and it became thick as a tree trunk from consuming everything in its path
- **Digestive Horrors**: Multiple large bulges throughout its body from undigested prey - some still recognizably human-shaped, others containing livestock or large forest animals
- **Physical Changes**: Scales have hardened to almost armor-like consistency, providing natural protection. Eyes grown larger to spot prey from greater distances
- **Venom Evolution**: Corruption has intensified its venom to lethal levels - single bite can kill multiple adult humans, causes hallucinations and paralysis before death
- **Movement Limitations**: The numerous bulges make normal serpentine movement difficult, forcing it to move in awkward, lurching motions between prey
- **Ambush Mastery**: Despite slower movement, strike speed remains lightning-fast. Can remain motionless for days waiting for prey
- **Territory Marking**: Leaves shed skin pieces throughout its mountain territory, each one massive enough to be mistaken for discarded rope or cloth

## Baek Clan - Sea Territory (MC's Clan)
**Corrupted Massive Whale**

- **Size**: Grown to impossible proportions through endless consumption - easily twice the size of the largest natural whales, visible from miles away when surfacing
- **Feeding Method**: Despite having no teeth, its massive jaws create thunderous booms when snapping shut, the sound audible for miles across the ocean
- **Battle History**: Body covered in countless scars from encounters with everything the sea could throw at it - deep gouges from shark attacks, circular scars from cannon impacts, scattered puncture wounds from harpoons and spears
- **Ship Consumption**: Interior of mouth lined with splinter scars and metal fragments from the dozens of ships it has consumed whole, treating vessels as just another type of prey
- **Growth Pattern**: Achieved its size by systematically hunting and eating other whales, leaving the ocean around it nearly barren of large sea life
- **Territorial Limitation**: Has grown too massive to enter shallow waters or approach coastlines, effectively trapped in the deep ocean but dominating everything within its reach
- **Hunting Behavior**: Indiscriminately attacks and consumes anything that enters its territory - ships, sea creatures, even floating debris
- **Embedded Evidence**: MC's father's sword remains lodged deep in its flesh, a testament to the fisherman's final desperate battle against this oceanic nightmare
