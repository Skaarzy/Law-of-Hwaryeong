**Bul-ho** (불호) — The Enlightened One, Deity of Wisdom, Compassion, and Liberation

Bul-won is a timeless spiritual entity embodying ultimate wisdom, compassion, and liberation from suffering. Neither born nor mortal, he exists beyond the cycle of birth and death, a radiant presence of pure enlightenment that guides lost souls toward awakening.
His form is serene and radiant, often depicted in calm meditation or standing in grace, he chosses to look like a child because its the most simple and pure form of the human symbolizing perfect balance and inner peace. Bul-won’s presence dispels ignorance and fear, illuminating the path to spiritual freedom with unshakable clarity.Enemies in his presence may feel their aggression fade. Rage becomes sorrow. Power becomes stillness. Illusions crack. Truth surfaces. Cultivators with unstable minds may fall into deep reflection or be forced to confront their inner demons.
Worshipped as the divine embodiment of truth, Bul-won watches over the realms of spirit and mind, judging not with wrath, but with infinite mercy and understanding. Those who seek his guidance find strength to overcome darkness within themselves and the world.When he is in his child form his power is sealed and he doesn't use it he can still do thing with the child form power like telekinesis and summing or telephoning himself , but when he unseales his ultimate form he become the ultimate Bul-won who looks like the last pic , his power is the power of Emptiness,  Liberation a divine force that erases suffering, dissolves energy, and returns all things to silence and truth. His power does not destroy; it unburdens. It strips away the false, the clinging, the violent leaving only clarity. Floating gently behind Bul-won in a perfect orbit are round, glowing golden spheres each inscribed with a single word or sutra character — concepts like _Silence_, _Compassion_, _Truth_, _Release_, _Mercy_, or _Void_. They rotate slowly around him in a luminous halo, like a sun broken into divine thoughts. Their surface glows with a warm, otherworldly gold, casting soft light wherever he goes. Each sphere is more than just a symbol it is a _manifestation of a spiritual law_. When he activates them:
"Silence" causes sound and qi to vanish in an area.
"Compassion" purifies poison or mental affliction.  
"Truth" dispels illusions or lies.
"Void" erases attacks, severing the energy behind them. A single raised hand can stop raging storms, nullify violent qi, or still time for those around him. He doesn’t resist attacks he simply renders them meaningless.

## **Divine Bul-ho Encounter – Silent Temple Library**

**Location:**
- Abandoned temple library, shelves overflowing with scrolls and dust.
- Candles flicker despite no wind.
- A child monk/Bul-ho sits cross-legged in the center, surrounded by open books, **reading silently**.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera pans across rows of scrolls to Bul-ho in the center.
2. He is **utterly motionless**, not even turning pages.
3. The MC can hear their own footsteps echo unnaturally loud.
4. Bul-ho suddenly **closes the book with a snap** that echoes like thunder.
5. He looks directly at the MC with eyes that seem both ancient and empty:
    > "You came looking for something. But you don't know what it is yet."

6. He returns to his book, ignoring the MC completely.
7. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player examines any scroll or book:
    > "All these words... and still, silence teaches more."

**Cutscene 2 (Approach or Sit):**
- If the MC approaches or sits nearby, Bul-ho speaks without looking up:
    > "Suffering isn't the enemy. Attachment to suffering is."

- He finally looks up, studying the MC carefully.
    > "You carry weight. Old wounds, old anger. Tell me—does holding onto it make you stronger? Or just... heavier?"

- Long pause. He places his hand on the book he's reading.
    > "Wisdom isn't knowing everything. It's knowing what to ignore."

- He stands slowly, walks toward the open gate door which sunlight fills.
- Before disappearing, he turns back:
    > "Liberation begins when you stop punishing yourself for being human."

- Before he vanishes he smiles softly and enter the light almost disappearing in it.
- When the MC looks at where he sat, there's a **simple wooden prayer bead** left behind on the closed book.

**Reward:**

- **Enlightened Bead** (rare decoration material) – Can be worn on wrist, it increases health by 10% .Look simple but higher level monks and scholars can see its unique.
