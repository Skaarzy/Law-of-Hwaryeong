In the shadowed corners of the Murim world, beyond mortal comprehension, dwell the deities—ancient, beings who embody cosmic forces, elemental powers, and the spiritual ideals that shape the realm. These deities are not mere gods of worship but living manifestations of balance, wisdom, and cosmic law all guided by Dao .They take form of humans when visiting earth which also weakens them, their human form cannot die but can be damaged to the point that the deity must retrieve to their original realm—their main body and presence is that of awe and power. They can rarely intervene directly in worldly affairs as Dao makes it impossible, but they may guide, test, or challenge mortals through subtle signs, dreams, or rare encounters, 
Each deity governs a domain of influence—be it nature, fate, enlightenment, war, or harmony—and their power weaves through the very fabric of Murim. While mostly benevolent or neutral, deities expect respect and reverence, for their favor can uplift or their wrath unravel the threads of destiny.Mortals who earn their attention find themselves changed, gaining wisdom, strength, or profound insight, but the price of such gifts is often a deeper understanding of the fragile balance between power and humility.The Deity's themselves are made specify to clash and contradict the other make the balance of dao
