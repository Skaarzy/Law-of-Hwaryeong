## **Seong-jun Encounter – Ancient Mountain Spring**

**Location:**

- Hidden mountain spring surrounded by ancient old trees.
- The water is crystal clear, reflecting the sky perfectly.
- The air feels unusually pure and calm here—no sounds except water trickling and wind through branches.
- Seong-jun sits on a flat stone beside the spring playing a jade flute, legs crossed, wearing fine noble robes and a neoul straw hat with a veil next to him.
- His long white beard flows over his chest, and his white hair catches the light almost unnaturally.
- His posture is perfect, dignified, radiating quiet strength and vitality despite his ancient appearance.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC climbing a mountain path, discovering the hidden spring.
2. Pan across the tranquil scene to Seong-jun sitting motionless beside the water.
3. He doesn't acknowledge the MC's arrival and keeps playing the clam song on the flute—completely still, hands resting on his knees in meditation.
4. The only movement is the gentle sway of his hair and beard in the breeze.
5. Suddenly he opens his eye to reveal a their golden color, and stop the playing of the flute to  speak :
    > "This spring has flowed for eight hundred years. Healing those who find it. Unchanging. Unbroken."

6. Another pause.
    > "Do you know how rare that is? For something to endure without losing its purpose or strength?"

7. He finally tilts his head slightly toward the MC, the veil shifting to reveal gentle, piercing eyes.
8. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player approaches the spring or examines the water:
    > "Drink, if you wish. True healing can begin with a single sip,but the water will be useless unless u know how heal yourself."


**Cutscene 2 (Approach, Sit, or Drink):**
- If the MC approaches, sits, or drinks from the spring, Seong-jun remains still for a moment.
- Then he gestures gracefully toward the water, and **several small light circles appear**, floating gently above the surface like lily pads made of soft luminescence:
    > "Life persists through balance. Light and shadow. Growth and stillness. Heat and cold. Most only embrace one side."

- He finally turns his veiled face fully toward the MC, and the eye golden color fades slowly:
    > "All carry wounds. Some of them bleed some don't . From some pain lingers for years... decades even. Waiting to be acknowledged , the longer u ignore them the bigger scar they leave in the end."

- His voice remains calm, measured, but carries deep compassion:
    > "Longevity is not merely surviving longer. It is choosing, each day, to heal rather than harden."

- He reaches into his robes and produces a small medicinal herb wrapped in silk, holding it with reverence:
    > "Enlightenment begins when you stop running from what hurts. When you sit with it and accept it as a part of u.... let it pass through like wind through open trees."

- He places the herb on the stone between them:
    > "Healing is not complicated. It offers no glory. But it is the most sacred act—to mend what is broken, including oneself."

- A **ray of light** briefly forms behind him, warm and radiant like a small sun hits the Mcs eyes, before fading:
    > "This spring has witnessed empires crumble and be reborn. It does not despair. It simply... continues to heal and accepts its fate."
 
- He stands slowly, with perfect noble posture, his white beard and hair seeming to glow in the filtered sunlight:
    > "You will face battles that wound more than flesh. Remember—the body heals easier than the spirit does. Tend to both equally."

- He walks toward the path leading deeper into the mountains, each step measured, deliberate, vital despite his age.
- Before disappearing into the mountain mist, he pauses and looks back:
    > "Enlightenment is not a destination. It is the journey of understanding yourself deeply enough to accept what you find."

- As he walks away, **small rays of light** appear briefly along the path behind him, fading like footprints made of warmth.
- He vanishes into the mist.
- When the MC looks back at the spring, **the water glows faintly for a moment**, and they feel a subtle warmth spread through their body—old aches easing slightly.
- On the stone where he sat, there's a **small sealed vial of spring water** and the silk-wrapped jade flute, still radiating faint warmth.
