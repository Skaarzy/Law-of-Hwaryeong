Master **Jeon-ho** (전호) — The Resolute Deity of War, Peace, and Judgment

Master Jeon-hwa embodies the duality of conflict and harmony. Clad in armor that seamlessly blends martial robustness with serene elegance, his presence commands both respect and tranquility. His visage is often depicted as calm and composed, reflecting his role as a mediator between war and peace.
As the arbiter of justice, Jeon-hwa oversees the balance between aggression and diplomacy. He guides warriors to fight with honor and leaders to seek peaceful resolutions. In times of turmoil, his counsel is sought to restore equilibrium, ensuring that neither chaos nor complacency prevails.He uses a heavenly drum as his primary weapon which he strikes with his palm its said the sound of it can break realty of realms and crack space and time.The scroll even though its a secondary weapon its more powerful than the drum , once he uses the scroll it means that he won, when he opens the scroll and say one of the 3 words which are war peace or judgment every word has its meaning war kill a person with the strength of every war every fought , peace protects or heals usual himself but can be used on others and can make his enemy stop and reconsider fighting him, judgment as its called judges the person he chooses if the person is evil it can bring them to their knees from the pressure and make them immobile and even stops them from breathing its like a arrest even though they don't breath or their heart doesn't beat it just means they are in a timeless loop like a prison in their own body 

**Location:**
- A small hill overlooking a valley where a battle rages below.
- Bandits clash violently with local warriors—swords clashing, men screaming, blood being spilled.
- Master Jeon-ho stands alone at the hill's peak, hands clasped behind his back, watching silently.
- He's a massive man—tall, somewhat chubby, in his 50s, with a large white topknot and a clean, impressive white beard.
- His presence is like stone—unmoving, silent, heavy.
- The sounds of battle echo up the hill, but he remains perfectly still.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC climbing the hill, hearing the battle below.
2. As they reach the top, they see Jeon-ho's broad back, standing motionless.
3. The camera pans past him to show the brutal fighting in the valley—men dying, chaos, violence.
4. Jeon-ho doesn't acknowledge the MC's presence at all.
5. Wind moves his beard slightly; otherwise, complete stillness.
6. After a long silence, he speaks without moving, voice deep and flat:
    > "They've been fighting for three hours."

7. Another long pause as a scream echoes from below.
    > "Forty-two dead. More will follow."

8. He doesn't turn, doesn't move—just continues watching.
9. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player moves to stand beside him or tries to look at his face:
    > "Do you see justice down there? Or just men killing men?"

**Cutscene 2 (Stay and Watch):**
- If the MC stays and watches with him, Jeon-ho remains silent for a long moment.
- The battle continues below—someone falls, another charges.
- Finally, Jeon-ho speaks, voice quiet but carrying immense weight:
    > "The bandits raid because they're starving. The warriors defend because they're ordered. Both believe they're right."

- He slowly turns his head to look at the MC—his eyes are cold, ancient, tired.
    > "War never cares who's right. Only who's left standing."

- He turns back to the battle below.
    > "Most face moments like this. Where steel is the only answer left. Where words have already failed."

- He finally moves and stop right behind the mc. His presence feels unbearably heavy.
    > "When that moment comes, don't lie to yourself. Don't call it justice. Don't call it mercy."

- He start walking further.
    > "Call it what it is: your judgment of others. And know that same judgment is what comes after you...if u face it head on u will meet peace after, but if you try to avoid it u will find WAR."

- He begins walking down the opposite side of the hill, away from the battle, hands still clasped behind his back.
- Before disappearing over the ridge, he pauses without turning:
    > "Judgment is easy when you're not the one deciding. Living with it... that's the real battle."

- He vanishes over the hill.
- When the MC looks back at the valley, **the battle has suddenly stopped**—warriors emerged victorious, celebrating before slowly withdrawing.
- Where Jeon-ho stood, there's a **worn stone token** with a scale carved into it, heavy and cold to the touch.

**Reward:**
- **Judge's Token** (rare accessory) – Increases reputation gains and losses by 20% (choices matter more). Worn as a pendant. Simple but weighty.
