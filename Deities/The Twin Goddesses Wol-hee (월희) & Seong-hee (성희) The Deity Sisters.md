The Twin Goddesses **Wol-hee** (월희) and **Seong-hee** (성희) The Deity Sisters of Time Memory and Dreams

Wol-hwa and Seong-un are twin goddesses who drift silently through the flow of time. Shrouded in twilight-colored robes, their appearance is ghostlike and distant—one veiled in soft moonlight, the other lit with drifting starlight. 
Wol-hwa governs Memory and the Past, keeper of forgotten names and ancient sorrows. Her breath stirs old ruins and echoes through ancestral prayers.  
Seong-un guides Dreams and What Is Yet to Be, whispering to prophets, artists, and fools alike. Her steps leave no mark, but shape what follows.
Together, they govern Time, not as rulers, but as witnesses—watching all rise, all fade, and all return.
Their personalities are similar to what they govern, Wol-hwa usually is more sleepy and bored wiht reminiscing on the past bringing up random things in conversations that happened in the past.
Her sister Seong-un is more of a busy body and has a bubbly personality always ready to do something and planing things way in the future , always talking about imagenrly palces and telling grand usually exaggerated stories.


## **Wol-hwa Encounter – Ground Floor Tavern**

**Location:**
- Ground floor of a modest two-story building in a quiet town.
- Simple tavern with a few patrons eating and drinking quietly.
- Wol-hwa, a bulky, masculine-featured woman with strong shoulders and capable hands, works behind the counter—wiping cups, serving food efficiently.
- She has an easy, relaxed demeanor, chatting casually with regulars.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC entering the tavern in the evening.
2. Wol-hwa is laughing at something a customer said, slapping the counter good-naturedly.
3. She spots the MC and waves them over casually:
    > "Hey! New face. Come on, sit. You look like you need a drink."

4. As the MC sits, she pours them something without asking, sets it down.
5. She leans on the counter, studying the MC's face with casual interest:
    > "Huh. You remind me of someone. Can't quite place it though."

6. She shrugs, grinning slightly:
    > "Happens a lot in my line of work. See so many faces, they all start blending together."
    
7. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player examines old decorations or asks about the tavern:
    > "This place? Been here longer than anyone remembers. Even me, probably." (laughs)

**Cutscene 2 (Stay and Talk):**
- If the MC stays and drinks, Wol-hwa comes back after serving others.
- She refills their cup, leaning against the counter comfortably:
    > "You got that look, you know. Like you're trying to forget something. Or maybe remember it."

- She wipes down the counter idly:
    > "Funny thing about memories. The ones you want to keep? Those slip away. The ones you want gone? Those stick like tree sap."

- She stops cleaning and looks at the MC directly now, more serious:
    > "Whatever you're carrying from back then—it's still with you. Whether you remember it clearly or not."

- She straightens up, back to her casual demeanor:
    > "Anyway. My sister upstairs does the fortune-telling thing. I just pour drinks and like to listen to interesting stories." (laughs) "Easier job, if you ask me."

- A customer calls for her; she pats the counter:
    > "Stick around if you want. Or don't. Either way... I’ll keep you in mind."

- She walks off to serve others.
- When the MC looks at their table, there's a **small old key** left on a worn piece of paper with their name written on it—in handwriting they don't recognize but feels familiar.
**Reward:**
- **Forgotten Key** (rare accessory/quest item) – Opens a locked chest somewhere in the world that contains an item tied to the MC's past. The key feels old, like it's been waiting a long time.


## **Seong-un Encounter – Second Floor Fortune-Telling Room**
**Location:**
- Second floor of the same building, accessed by wooden stairs.
- A quiet, intimate room filled with the scent of incense.
- Seong-un sits at a low table, yarrow stalks, coins, and divination tools arranged precisely.
- She's slimmer, more delicate than her sister, with distant, dreamlike eyes.
- Candles flicker, casting long shadows.

**Cutscene 1:**
- If the MC climbs the stairs, they enter a dimly lit room.
- Seong-un sits at a low table, yarrow stalks and coins arranged before her.
- She doesn't look up immediately, her fingers tracing patterns in the air above the divination tools.
> "Sit. You've been standing at a crossroads for longer than you realize."

4. The MC enters; Seong-un doesn't look up, focused on the coins before her.
5. > "Sit."
6. The MC sits across from her.

- She finally looks up—her eyes are distant, dreamlike, seeing through rather than at the MC:
> "I don't tell futures. I whisper them. To dreamers, to madmen, to those desperate enough to listen."

- She picks up the yarrow stalks, letting them fall naturally:
    > "Dreams aren't lies. They're possibilities waiting to be born. What you dream tonight might become real a tomorrow."

- She studies the fallen stalks, then the MC's face, then their hands:
    > "Your path ahead is not set. It shifts with every choice. But some things... some things are already moving toward you."

- She looks at their palm closely:
    > "You'll meet someone you've already lost. Or lose someone you have met. Time doesn't care which comes first."
8. **Cutscene ends.**

**Cutscene 2 (Stay for Reading):**
- Seong-un gestures to the MC's hands:
    > "Give me your palm."

- If the MC complies, she traces the lines slowly, not quite touching the skin:
    > "You walk two paths. One you chose. One that chose you."


- She lets go of the Mc and stands slowly, moving toward the window:
    > "What is yet to come is already dreaming itself awake. You are part of that dream."

- She looks out at the darkening sky:
    > "My sister remembers what was. I see what wants to be. Together, we witness. We do not command or control."

- She turns back, her form seeming to blur slightly in the candlelight:
    > "You will forget most of this when the choice come by either ignoring my words or going your own way. But that's how its meant to be, neither i or nobody else has the control of your dreams and choices u make in them."

- The candles flicker strongly—**Seong-un** sits back down.
- The room feels suddenly empty, as if untouched for years.
- On the table, there's a **small dreamcatcher made of strange thread** and a **coin with two faces**—one showing a moon, one showing a star.

**Reward:**
- **Dreamweaver's Token** (rare accessory) – Occasionally grants brief premonitions of danger (dodge chance +5%).
- **Two-Faced Coin** (rare consumable) – can be used to buy a item for free.
