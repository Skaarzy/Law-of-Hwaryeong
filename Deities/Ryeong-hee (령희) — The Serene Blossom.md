**Ryeong-hee** (령희)— The Serene Blossom a Divine Weaver of Love, Hope and Harmony  

Ryeong-hee is a radiant spirit whose presence flows like a gentle breeze over still waters, embodying the seamless balance between love, beauty, and harmony. She is pale white-skinned and wears flowing white robes that ripple softly with her every movement. A slender sword rests lightly in her hand—the only thing left from her beloved, a cherished symbol of their enduring bond. Her aura exudes warmth and calm, inspiring those who encounter her to seek unity within themselves and with others. With eyes that reflect the soft hues of dawn and a smile that brings peace to troubled hearts, she moves gracefully, weaving invisible threads that bind souls and nurture lasting bonds. Neither possessive nor forceful, Cheong-ryeong’s influence encourages growth through understanding and gentle transformation, reminding mortals that true beauty blooms from harmony and heartfelt connection.Considered a simple and unimportant deity yet being one of mayor importance as without her hope would not exists. Her power is the control of making a person feel complete and have no regrets or necessity for resentment or anger, her sword is more of a artifact than a weapon as its said in stories that it was her loved ones sword which he gave to her after he died, mostly worshiped by those who seek love and hope for most things, she is the only deity that the others cant and don't want to harm.

## **Ryeong-hee Encounter – Broken Bridge at Dawn**

**Location:**

- A half-collapsed wooden bridge over a gorge at sunrise.
- Morning mist rises from below; the bridge sways slightly in the wind.
- Ryeong-hee stands at the broken edge, facing the gap, completely still.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC approaching the bridge from behind.
2. Ryeong-hee is humming a soft, sad melody—barely audible over the wind.
3. She **doesn't turn** but stops humming as the MC gets closer.
4. Long silence. Then she speaks without turning:
    > "It broke three days ago. Seven people fell. Their families still come here... waiting."

5. She gestures vaguely toward the far side—there are **small offerings**: flowers, food, letters tied to posts.
    > "They leave these. As if love could bring them back."

6. **Cutscene ends.**
**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player tries to leave:
    > "Strange, isn't it? They are gone, but those still here keep waiting for them to return. Their hope is stronger than most others."

**Cutscene 2 (Approach):**
- If the MC walks closer, Ryeong-hee finally turns, smiling gently but with sad eyes.
- > "Do you think hope is foolish? Or is it the only thing that matters?"
- She looks back at the offerings across the gap.
    > "Seven are gone forever. But look—" she gestures at the far side, "—They won't be forgotten ever. Isn't that more important than hope?"

- She look at her sword mournfully but then looks at the sky and smiles again
    > "Harmony of love and hope isn't about with who u share your love. It's about if u are willing to let them cross feeling the love while you, after they are gone, feel the pain."

- She jumps across the broken bridge effortlessly, disappears into the mist on the other side.
- When the MC looks down, there's **a single rare flower** lying where she stood—petals still fresh with morning dew.
- The offerings remain on the far side, untouched.

**Reward:**
- **Serene Blossom** (rare crafting material) – Can be used to create powerful healing tonics or medicines. Extremely rare in the wild.
