Master **Mok-jun** (목준)— The Jovial Deity of Merriment, Wandering Spirits, and Freedom

Master Un-Mok is a lively and charismatic deity embodying the joyous spirit of merriment, the restless nature of wandering spirits, and the boundless essence of freedom. Known for his boisterous laughter and carefree demeanor, he moves through towns and festivals with infectious energy, drawing people into celebration and revelry. Though often found drinking and sharing tales among locals, Un-Mok’s true nature is elusive—appearing and vanishing like a fleeting breeze. As a deity, he champions the freedom to roam without restraint, the joy found in companionship and laughter, and the unseen spirits that wander the world seeking connection. His presence is a reminder that life’s greatest gifts are found in joyous freedom and the bonds formed along the way. An older, stout man who appears unexpectedly at a lively city festival. His carefree extroversion and loud merriment draw attention naturally, making him a memorable figure among the crowd. Though he seems like just a jovial wanderer,and a old drunk he is far more — a deity cloaked in the guise of a common man, traveling unnoticed among mortals.He is unlike other deities because he like to wander around and have fun and drink but he is still as powerful as the other deities.Somewhat of a sassy older man as well.Also the father of the Heavenly demon. His clothes are almost like clouds just floating around 

## **Master Mok-jun Encounter – Village Tavern**

**Location:**
- Small village tavern in the evening, filled with locals unwinding after a day's work.
- Simple wooden tables, modest food and drink being shared.
- Master Mok-jun sits at a corner table, a short, fat, jolly old man with a huge grin.
- He's loud, laughing boisterously, surrounded by empty bottles and several amused villagers.
- His presence is infectious—everyone near him seems happier, more relaxed.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC entering the quiet village tavern, sounds of conversation and occasional laughter.
2. Zoom through the modest interior to Mok-jun at his table, slamming his cup down.
3. He's mid-story, gesturing wildly with his drink sloshing everywhere:
    > "—AND THEN! The monk says, 'That's not enlightenment, that's just indigestion!' HAHAHA!"

4. The villagers around him erupt in laughter; Mok-jun laughs hardest of all, belly shaking.
5. He suddenly spots the MC and stand up enthusiastically pointing at the MC:
    > "YOU! Yes, YOU! Don't just stand there looking like all sad and lost like a wet dog! Come! SIT! DRINK!"

6. He pours a cup sloppily, half the liquor missing the cup entirely.
7. The villagers chuckle and gesture for the MC to join.
8. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player tries to leave or ignore him:
    > "Running already?! Life's too short to run from a good drink! U will regret it later!"

**Cutscene 2 (Approach and Sit):**
- If the MC approaches, Mok-jun shoves the cup into their hand immediately.
> "THERE we go! A face that needs loosening up! Drink, drink!"

- He takes a massive gulp from his own cup, wiping his mouth with his sleeve.
- The villagers around him gradually return to their own conversations, giving them space.
- Mok-jun leans back, grinning wide:
    > "You know what your problem is? Too much thinking! Too much worrying!"

- He taps his temple repeatedly:
    > "Up here—always spinning, always planning. But down HERE—" he slaps his belly, "—nothing! Empty!"

- He laughs again, but then his eyes sharpen for just a moment, studying the MC:
    > "Freedom isn't about having no chains. It's about dancing even when you're wearing them."

- He suddenly stands on his chair, raising his cup high to the whole tavern:
    > "To freedom! To untamed spirits! To doing whatever the HELL you want before the ground claims you!"

- The tavern responds with scattered cheers and raised cups.
- He jumps down (surprisingly gracefully for his size) and leans close to the MC almost whispering:
    > "Spirits aren't just ghosts, you know. They're moments. Laughter. Joy. The things people remember when they're being too busy working or doing 'important things.'"

- He pats the MC's shoulder hard:
    > "Don't forget to live, eh? All that struggling and fighting—what's it FOR if you die unhappy?"

- He suddenly turns and walks toward the door, stumbling singing and laughing.
- At the doorway, he looks back one last time:
    > "I'll see you all around! Maybe! Who knows! THAT'S the fun part!"

- He walks out and slams the door while the villager cheer him and raise their cups ,and the MC can still hear his loud singing outside fading down the street.
- When the MC looks at their table, there's a **small worn drinking cup** left behind, surprisingly well-crafted despite looking plain.

Player can meet him : 

At the bustling city festival, outside a small tavern, a few tables were set up along the street with simple wooden chairs and barrels of drink. One table, small and humble, held five chairs, and around it sat some local villagers laughing heartily and passing cups back and forth. Among them was an old, stout man with a round face, wearing simple but well-worn clothes. He laughed louder than most, a little too loud perhaps, and drank deeply from a half-empty barrel resting on the table. Two other barrels stood by the side, clearly empty but still close enough to suggest he had been drinking for quite some time.
Then, as the main character’s eyes drifted away—drawn by the clamor of the festival or a colorful dancer—the old man suddenly vanished. Not a trace of him remained. The barrels stayed, and the locals continued their revelry as if the old man had never existed. No one at the table batted an eye; they drank and laughed on, unaware of the mysterious guest who had just disappeared.
