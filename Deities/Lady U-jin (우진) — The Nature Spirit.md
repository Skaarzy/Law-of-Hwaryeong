Lady **U-jin** (우진) — The Nature Spirit , deity of nature, animals and birth

Clad in flowing robes that ripple like a gentle breeze, Lady **U-jin** moves with the grace of a bird in flight. Her serene white makeup, adorned with delicate feather-like patterns, hides an enigmatic gaze that observes the world with quiet wisdom. She is calm and composed, yet ever curious—like the wind that shifts direction without warning, she is unpredictable but never cruel.
As the divine herald, she carries whispers and secret messages across the lands, guiding those who seek truth . She is also honored as the silent breath that brings souls into the world—the unseen wind that stirs just before a newborn’s first cry. Lady U-jin is gentle and patient, a listener who understands the language of silence and subtlety. Though elusive, she inspires hope and courage in those burdened by secrets or longing for liberation.
Her presence is both soothing and stirring, like the breeze before a storm—capable of calming the restless or awakening the hidden spirit within.

## **Lady U-jin Encounter – Forest Clearing Birth**

**Location:**
- Deep forest clearing at twilight.
- A doe lies in the grass, giving birth; the forest is unnaturally quiet—no birds, no wind.
- Lady U-jin, dressed in fine but practical clothes, kneels beside the deer, hands resting gently near it.
- She's tall, thin, with a stern face softened by a gentle smile as she watches.
- Her presence feels both maternal and commanding.

**Cutscene 1:**
1. Camera shows the MC entering the clearing, footsteps muffled by grass.
2. Lady U-jin doesn't look up, completely focused on the laboring doe.
3. She raises one hand slightly—a silent gesture for the MC to stop and be quiet.
4. The doe breathes heavily; Lady U-jin strokes its neck slowly, humming something wordless.
5. After a long moment, she speaks softly without turning:
    > "Life emerges in silence. Speak carelessly, and you'll disturb what's sacred."

6. The fawn begins to emerge; Lady U-jin's expression remains calm, focused.
7. **Cutscene ends.**

**Voice Trigger:**
- If the player moves closer or makes noise:
    > "Patience. All things come when they're ready. Rushing only slows them down."

**Cutscene 2 (Stay and Watch):**
- If the MC stays still and waits, the fawn is fully born after a quiet moment.
- Lady U-jin gently touches the newborn's head, then helps it stand on shaky legs.
- She finally looks at the MC, her stern face softening into a warm but knowing smile:
    > "You've taken life before. Most do. But do you remember what it cost?"

- She stands slowly, brushing dirt from her fine clothes with care.
    > "Every birth is a promise. Every death, a debt. Nature keeps the balance—always."

- She looks around the clearing, and animals begin to emerge from the shadows—deer, foxes, birds perching silently on branches.
    > "They know. They always know when one of their own enters the world. Or leaves it."

- She walks toward the treeline, animals moving aside respectfully but following her.
- Before disappearing into the forest, she pauses and looks back:
    > "You'll take more lives. That's your path. Just try to remember every life u take has five others that are tied to it ,and depending on it."

- She steps into the thick forest; the animals follow in a silent procession.
- When she's gone, **the forest comes alive** with sound again—birds singing, wind rustling leaves.
- Near where the doe rested, there's a **small carved wooden charm** shaped like a curled fawn, still warm.

**Reward:**
- **Fawn's Blessing Charm** (rare accessory) – Reduces damage taken from beasts by 15%. Animals are less likely to attack first. Worn around the neck or wrist.
