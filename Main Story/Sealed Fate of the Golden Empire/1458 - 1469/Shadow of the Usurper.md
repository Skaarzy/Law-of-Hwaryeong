**Chapter V: Shadow of the Usurper (1465)**

Two years into Emperor Dong Tak's reign, the throne room had transformed from a place of justice into a chamber of fear. Dong Tak sat in power, but his paranoia grew with each passing day, twisting him into something far darker than the revolutionary hero he had once pretended to be. The officials who had helped him seize the throne now found themselves under constant scrutiny, realizing too late that they had merely traded one master for a far more vicious one.

The purge began subtly. Dong Tak wielded the blackmail evidence from Kim's documents like a blade, using the aristocratic conspirators' own treasonous seals to control the court. Those who resisted even slightly received visits from his enforcers—men whose loyalty was purchased through fear and whose methods left no room for mercy. Officials vanished in the night, their names systematically erased from records as if they had never existed. Others confessed to fabricated crimes under torture, their broken testimonies used to justify further purges and tighten the emperor's grip on power.

What began as blackmail through documentary evidence gradually evolved into something far more terrible. Dong Tak realized a fundamental truth: he didn't need proof when he possessed absolute power. The blackmail shifted from "I have evidence of your treason" to the simpler, more brutal "Obey or die." Threats of death became the new currency of loyalty, and officials who had once wielded considerable influence now competed desperately to prove their devotion through increasingly extreme acts of servility and cruelty.

The imperial court was systematically remade in Dong Tak's image. He promoted corrupt officials who would do anything for power, The Iron Fist Sect receives official recognition and imperial guards and the official protectors of the empire, rewarded for their loyalty during the rebellion, men and women whose lack of principle made them perfectly suited to serve a tyrant's whims. Those with integrity were eliminated or forced into terrified silence, their positions filled by sycophants and monsters who understood that survival required absolute submission. The machinery of government, once designed to serve the people, became a refined tool of terror that operated with ruthless efficiency.

Through the court, whispers circulated about a missing prince—the young heir who had been groomed by Kim Jae-hwan before the conspiracy's violent conclusion. No one dared speak of it openly. Dong Tak's spies infiltrated every corner of the palace, listening for any hint of disloyalty or forbidden knowledge. The hunt for surviving Royal bloodline members intensified with quiet desperation, though publicly the topic was treated as if it didn't exist. Officials learned quickly that asking questions about the missing prince was the surest path to a midnight disappearance.

The imperial court had become Dong Tak's complete creation—ruthless, paranoid, and terribly efficient at maintaining his rule through fear. The empire suffered under his governance, but dissent had become impossible. Fear had entirely replaced loyalty, and the population learned to perform enthusiasm for the regime while hiding their true thoughts behind carefully constructed masks. Yet somewhere in the provinces, hidden by those brave or foolish enough to defy the usurper, a young prince survived. Dong Tak didn't yet know where, but his relentless hunt continued, spreading terror throughout the realm as his agents searched for the one person whose very existence threatened the legitimacy of his stolen throne.

**Key Characters:**

- Emperor Dong Tak: Paranoid usurper consolidating power through terror
- The Conspirators: Trapped aristocrats now victims of their own treason
- The Enforcers: Brutal agents maintaining Dong Tak's control
- The Missing Prince: Hidden heir representing hope and threat
- Corrupt Officials: Sycophants filling the remade imperial court

**Consequences:** Dong Tak's reign of terror demonstrated how revolutionary rhetoric could mask the rise of tyranny far worse than what it replaced. His transformation of blackmail into raw terror, and his systematic replacement of principled officials with corrupt servants, created a government machinery designed solely to maintain his power rather than serve the empire's needs. The missing prince became a ghost haunting the regime, his mere existence forcing Dong Tak into ever-greater paranoia and violence.
