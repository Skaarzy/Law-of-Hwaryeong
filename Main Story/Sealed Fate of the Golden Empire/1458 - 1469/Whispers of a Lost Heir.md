**Chapter VI: Whispers of a Lost Heir (1466)**

Three years into Dong Tak's reign, a rumor reached the emperor's ears that shook him to his core. A terrified servant whispered the words that would haunt every waking moment: "There may be a surviving prince." Dong Tak's carefully maintained control shattered, his paranoia erupting into rage that sent tremors through the entire palace. The one thing he had never verified, never confirmed, had returned to threaten everything he had built on blood and lies.

Dong Tak mobilized his resources with obsessive fury. Search parties scoured every province.The Iron Fist Sect deploys its members as agents in the manhunt, their martial skills making them effective hunters, every village, turning over stones and interrogating travelers. Massive rewards were offered for information, enough gold to make even loyal subjects consider betrayal. Anyone suspected of harboring the prince faced brutal interrogation, and the empire's resources drained into this singular manhunt. The already suffering realm now groaned under the additional burden of the emperor's paranoia made manifest.

Finally, Dong Tak's agents captured someone—a minor official who had served in the palace during the coup years earlier. The man was dragged before the emperor, his protests of innocence ignored. Under torture in the palace dungeons, he broke and told a story that made Dong Tak's blood run cold.

Years ago in 1463, when Dong Tak had killed Emperor Gwangheon, the young prince had been in the palace. The boy was only eleven years old, still grieving his mentor Kim Jae-hwan's sudden disappearance. Other ministers had approached the child, claiming that Kim had abandoned him, fled in cowardice. They promised to guide the prince, to install him as puppet emperor while they held real power. It was the same scheme Kim had originally planned, now being executed by his former co-conspirators.

But the prince's instincts had screamed danger. Something about Kim's disappearance didn't make sense. The minister had been paranoid about these very officials, warning the boy repeatedly about trusting anyone at court. Kim had spent years teaching him to question everything, to look for inconsistencies, to trust his judgment over others' words.

The prince had quietly searched Kim's private quarters, looking for answers. What he found confirmed his worst fears: Kim's family seal, worn always on his person. His ceremonial sword from military days, which he treasured above all possessions. Personal letters showing detailed plans to protect the prince during and after the coup, letters that ended mid-sentence as if interrupted. The realization struck the child with terrible clarity—Kim didn't abandon him. Kim was murdered.

If the ministers lied about Kim's fate, they were involved in his death. And if they had killed his protector and mentor, the prince would be next once they secured their power through his puppet reign. The eleven-year-old boy faced an impossible situation with no one he could trust.

The prince made a desperate decision. He couldn't turn to his father—Kim had spent years convincing him that Emperor Gwangheon was weak, untrustworthy, corrupted by foreign influences. The boy believed those lessons, even as his father's regime crumbled around him. He gathered only essential items: some gold, a small knife, and Kim's family seal as proof of his story. Using servants' passages and hidden routes that Kim had shown him during their "emergency preparation" lessons, he began his escape.

A few loyal people had helped the terrified child. This official, a minor functionary with access to travel documents, had provided false papers identifying the prince as a merchant's son and secured a horse. The prince had fled into the night, just a child running for his life from forces he barely understood. No one knew where he had gone or who might have sheltered him in the years since.

Dong Tak listened to the testimony with growing horror, his worst nightmare confirmed. The prince had escaped. The prince survived. The legitimate heir to the throne lived somewhere beyond his reach, a walking threat to everything he had built. The emperor executed the helpful official immediately, his screams echoing through the palace as a warning to others who might have aided the fugitive.

New orders issued from the throne with manic intensity: double the search parties, triple the rewards, execute anyone found harboring royal sympathizers. The hunt became Dong Tak's obsession, consuming his thoughts and the empire's resources. Somewhere out there, a royal heir lived and grew older, perhaps gathering support, perhaps plotting revenge. And Dong Tak would find him, no matter the cost to the realm or his own sanity.

**Key Characters:**

- Emperor Dong Tak: Paranoid usurper whose worst fear is confirmed
- The Missing Prince: Eleven-year-old fugitive who escaped the coup
- Minister Kim Jae-hwan: (deceased) Mentor whose murder the prince discovered
- The Captured Official: Minor functionary tortured into revealing the escape
- The Other Ministers: Conspirators who tried to use the prince as puppet

**Consequences:** The revelation of the prince's survival and the circumstances of his escape transformed Dong Tak's paranoia from generalized fear into focused obsession. The child's discovery of Kim's murder and subsequent flight demonstrated intelligence and survival instincts that made him far more dangerous than a simple figurehead. The prince's belief that his father was weak and untrustworthy, taught by Kim's years of manipulation, meant he might seek alternative allies rather than attempting to restore his father's regime, creating unpredictable complications for any who sought to use him for their own purposes.
