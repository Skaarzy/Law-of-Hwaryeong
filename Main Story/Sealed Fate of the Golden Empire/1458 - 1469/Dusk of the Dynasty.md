**Chapter IV: Dusk of the Dynasty (1463)**

The rebellion spread from the capital to surrounding provinces like wildfire, feeding on genuine grievances and carefully planted lies. More people joined Dong Tak's movement as Emperor Gwangheon's responses proved inadequate. Kim Jae-hwan called Dong Tak to a private meeting in the commoner district to finalize plans for the palace assault. The moment of overthrow approached, but Kim had no idea how completely he had misjudged his tool.

As Kim leaned forward to examine battle plans on the table, Dong Tak saw his opportunity. Why remain Kim's servant when he could be emperor? The dagger struck Kim's neck before the minister could turn. Dong Tak also used the Unortodx sect of the Iron Fist who helped dispose of the body in the slums where one more corpse would raise no questions.

The rebellion immediately raged beyond all control. Dong Tak spread his story swiftly: Kim Jae-hwan had fled after Dong Tak discovered his conspiracy. As proof, Dong Tak produced the sealed letters and documents—but edited them first, making the conspiracy look far bigger than it was. He claimed the entire court was corrupt, officials trying to control the empire for greed. He named officials who weren't even corrupt, simply to eliminate potential opposition. The people, prepared by months of Dong Tak's propaganda, believed every word.

The other conspirators realized the truth—Kim was dead, murdered by the commoner they had used. But they couldn't prove it without exposing themselves. Dong Tak held documents bearing their seals, proof of their treason. They faced a simple choice: death through exposure or survival through cooperation. They approached Dong Tak secretly, offering to help him from within. Dong Tak accepted with a cold smile. He needed their legitimacy, and they needed his silence.

Dong Tak's forces stormed the Forbidden City with the conspirators acting as inside agents, opening gates and identifying guard positions. Dong Tak personally killed Emperor Gwangheon, then spread the lie that the emperor had tried to flee "like a coward." He crowned himself emperor while the propaganda machine declared the conspirators "heroes" who had discovered corruption and helped restore proper rule. The dynasty's dusk had come, but the night promised to be far darker than anyone imagined.

**Key Characters:**

- Dong Tak: Commoner official turned murderer and usurper
- Minister Kim Jae-hwan: Conspirator betrayed and murdered by his own tool
- Emperor Gwangheon: Reform-minded ruler killed during the coup
- The Conspirators: Aristocratic plotters trapped into serving Dong Tak

**Consequences:** Dong Tak's betrayal demonstrated that revolutions devour their architects. His murder of Kim and manipulation of the conspirators showed ruthless intelligence that transformed him from pawn to player. The edited documents and false narratives created a new reality where Dong Tak appeared as hero rather than usurper, while the trapped conspirators became unwilling legitimizers of his rule.
