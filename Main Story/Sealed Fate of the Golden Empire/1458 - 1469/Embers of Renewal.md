 Chapter IX: Embers of Renewal  1587 - 1602
With Dong Zhou gone, the Jeong Dynasty stood at a crossroads. The young heir surprised all by refusing to seize the throne immediately. Instead, he called for the first Royal election, a radical gesture that gave the people the power to choose their next emperor. Candidates from across the land stepped forward, and for a year the nation debated, hoping to forge a new future from the ashes of the past. In the end, the young heir himself was chosen, becoming the first emperor ever elected by the people. The Royal court was restored, corrupt officials were brought to justice, and the relentless search for Dong Zhou continued. The Jeong Dynasty had survived its darkest hour and now faced a fragile dawn.

the wake of Dong Zhou’s disappearance, the Jeong Dynasty stood at a fragile crossroads. All eyes turned to the Royal heir — the quiet figure who had risen beside the sects through blood and fire — expecting him to seize the moment and claim the Dragon Throne. Yet in a move that shocked both ally and rival alike, he refused. Declaring that legitimacy could no longer be inherited or taken by force, he called for the first Royal election in recorded history. This radical gesture disarmed potential challengers and turned a fractured nation toward a common cause: choosing its next ruler not by blood, but by will.

**Part Two: The Year of Voices**  
Across the Jeong Dynasty, a storm of discourse rose. Provincial assemblies, sectarian halls, and scholar-official forums were flooded with debate. From mountain monasteries to river cities, emissaries carried questions and promises. Candidates emerged — former generals, philosopher-statesmen, even reformist monks — each seeking to capture the vision of a new age. The process, though chaotic and slow, united the realm in a way war never had. And when the votes were finally cast and counted, the Jeong Dynasty’s decision was both unexpected and symbolic: the young heir himself was chosen. He became the first emperor elected by the voice of the people, not the power of the sword.

**Part Three: A Cleansing Flame**  
With the new emperor crowned by public mandate, the court was restored — but it was not the same. No longer the den of fear that Dong Zhou had ruled from, it became a chamber of reckoning. Corrupt ministers, profiteers, and former collaborators were summoned before reformed tribunals and judged. Some were imprisoned, others exiled, and a few executed as examples. The emperor did not pursue vengeance but demanded accountability. He promoted officials from humble origins, many backed by the sects, and gave voice to new laws shaped by those who had suffered. The Jeong Dynasty’s wounds had not vanished, but the rot was being cut away, and the air began to clear.

**Part Four: The Vanishing Trail**  
Though the Jeong Dynasty turned toward healing, one figure remained conspicuously absent. Dong Zhou, whose rule had plunged the realm into chaos, had vanished in the final days of defeat. Whispers of his survival multiplied. Some claimed he lived among foreign kingdoms; others believed he had changed his face and name. Royal agents, supported by sect scouts, scoured trade routes, mountain passes, and old loyalist networks, but every trail ended in dust. The emperor declared the hunt would continue until justice was served, but many believed Dong Zhou had slipped forever into legend. His absence became a ghost behind every celebration — a warning that peace could still unravel.

Consequences:

With corrupt power rooted out and the court rebuilt, the foundations for a new age were laid. Yet the peace was young, and justice incomplete. As long as Dong Zhou’s fate remained unknown, so too did the final page of the rebellion. The embers of war still glowed — but for the first time in a generation, they burned with the promise of renewal rather than ruin.
