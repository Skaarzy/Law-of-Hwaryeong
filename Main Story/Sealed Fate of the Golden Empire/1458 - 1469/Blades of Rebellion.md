**Chapter III: Blades of Rebellion (1462)**

In a hidden chamber swept clean of prying ears, Minister Kim Jae-hwan gathered the empire's most traditional-minded officials. His voice carried the weight of conviction as he laid out his concerns: Emperor Gwangheon's embrace of foreign influences, his preference for guns over traditional weapons, his opening of trade to outsiders—all of it threatened the empire's very soul. The gathered officials listened with growing alarm as Kim painted a picture of cultural decay disguised as progress.

His solution was bold: overthrow Gwangheon and install the young crown prince as emperor. The boy could be guided by those who truly understood what the empire needed, shaped into a ruler who would restore tradition rather than abandon it. The officials debated the risks, but Kim had anticipated their concerns. They needed popular support to legitimize such action, to make it appear as the people's will rather than an aristocratic coup.

Kim revealed his masterstroke—a commoner-born official named Dong Tak would handle the groundwork. Kim also secured the Iron Fist Sect, an unorthodox martial school eager for legitimacy. Like Dong Tak, they would move through common districts spreading rumors and recruiting supporters—work beneath the dignity of orthodox sects but perfect for building grassroots momentum .Dong Tak's humble origins made him perfect for recruiting among the common people, for spreading carefully crafted messages about the emperor's failures. The beauty of the plan lay in its deception: Dong Tak would not be told the full conspiracy, only his specific role in building a grassroots movement.

Dong Tak took to his task with genuine fervor, moving through markets and street corners where nobles could never effectively reach. He found his audience among the desperate and angry—workers displaced by new methods, craftsmen threatened by foreign competition, veterans who resented firearms. These people needed little encouragement to voice their frustrations; they needed only someone to channel their rage toward the emperor himself.

The messages Dong Tak spread were simple but effective: foreign corruption explained their economic hardships, the emperor's reforms caused their social disruption, and traditional values offered the solution to every problem. That these sophisticated narratives supposedly emerged from spontaneous popular anger never struck most listeners as suspicious.

Meanwhile, Kim Jae-hwan worked two parallel tracks. He spent increasing time with the young crown prince, positioning himself as the boy's mentor and protector, gradually replacing the child's affection for his father with loyalty to his supposed guide. Simultaneously, Kim expanded the conspiracy's reach, recruiting more high officials who were convinced by his vision of traditional restoration.

The first organized protests appeared in the capital with sudden coordination. Dong Tak's recruited groups demanded change with slogans that resonated with genuine grievances while remaining controlled enough to avoid premature crackdown. The demonstrations were carefully calibrated—large enough to demonstrate popular discontent, but not so chaotic as to threaten the conspirators' own interests.

Armed skirmishes broke out in key districts, marking the rebellion's official beginning. These were not random eruptions but staged confrontations designed to test the government's response while gradually normalizing violence as part of the political landscape. Each clash provided intelligence about military deployment while demonstrating the movement's seriousness.

Kim Jae-hwan watched the unfolding chaos with satisfaction. The pieces he had positioned were moving exactly as planned—popular movement providing legitimacy, aristocratic conspirators providing organization, and the young prince waiting as the innocent figurehead who would unite all factions. The rebellion had begun, its sparks carefully lit and controlled, ready to grow into the inferno that would consume Emperor Gwangheon's reign.

**Key Characters:**

- **Minister Kim Jae-hwan**: Traditionalist official orchestrating the conspiracy from the shadows
- **Emperor Gwangheon**: Reform-minded ruler whose modernization threatens traditional power
- **Dong Tak**: Commoner-born official unknowingly serving elite conspirators
- **The Crown Prince**: Young heir being groomed as figurehead for traditionalist restoration
- **Aristocratic Conspirators**: High officials convinced to join Kim's plot

**Consequences:**

The rebellion's carefully orchestrated beginning demonstrated how elite conspiracies could disguise themselves as popular movements, using genuine grievances to serve hidden agendas. Kim Jae-hwan's layered deception created a situation where those who believed themselves revolutionaries were actually pawns, while the young prince's grooming ensured control over whatever government emerged. The transformation of peaceful protest into armed conflict marked the point of no return, committing all participants to a course that would either restore traditional power or destroy those who had dared to challenge the emperor's authority.
