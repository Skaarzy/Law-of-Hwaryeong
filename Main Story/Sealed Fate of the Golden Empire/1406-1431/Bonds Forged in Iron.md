**Chapter VII: Bonds Forged in Iron (1503-1504)** After witnessing 72 years of Royal decay and sectarian fragmentation, the remaining sect leaders finally abandon their traditional independence and forge a unprecedented alliance. The Orthodox Alliance unite under a single banner for the first time in history. They establish the [[Martial Council]], a governing body that transcends individual sect politics and focuses on protecting all martial artists and the communities they serve. This alliance creates unified training standards, shared resources, and coordinated responses to threats. Unlike their previous loose cooperation, this bond is formalized with blood oaths and sacred vows that cannot be easily broken. The sects realize that their survival depends not on maintaining ancient rivalries, but on presenting a united front against a world that has grown hostile to their very existence. For the first time since the demon war, they are truly one people with one purpose.

After witnessing the catastrophic collapse that has consumed both Jeong Dynasty and sectarian world over the past tumultuous years, the surviving sect leaders finally recognize that their traditional independence and ancient rivalries have become luxuries they can no longer afford in a world that has grown fundamentally hostile to their existence. What emerges from this recognition is not merely another temporary alliance of convenience, but a revolutionary transformation of the entire martial arts world that abandons centuries of established practice in favor of unprecedented unity and coordination.

**Part One: The Great Convergence**

The remaining sect leaders finally abandon their traditional independence and forge an unprecedented alliance that would have been unthinkable during the prosperity and security of earlier decades Even the surviving remnants of smaller schools, many reduced to handful of survivors, unite under a single banner for the first time in recorded history.

This convergence represents far more than political expedience, though practical necessity certainly drives the initial negotiations. The shared experience of persecution, exile, and fragmentation has created bonds between previously antagonistic groups that transcend their historical differences. Leaders who had spent decades viewing each other as rivals or threats now recognize that their common identity as martial artists supersedes the philosophical and methodological disputes that had once seemed so important.

The alliance formation process itself becomes a powerful symbol of transformation as representatives from groups that had never spoken directly begin working together to create something entirely new. Ancient protocols that had governed inter-sect relations are abandoned in favor of emergency procedures that prioritize effectiveness over tradition, marking a fundamental shift in how the martial arts world understands itself and its place in the broader world.

**Part Two: The Architecture of Unity**

They establish the Martial Council, a governing body that transcends individual sect politics and focuses on protecting all martial artists and the communities they serve, regardless of their traditional affiliations or methodological approaches. This institution represents a radical departure from the loose confederations and temporary alliances that had characterized previous attempts at inter-sect cooperation, creating instead a permanent structure with real authority and resources.

This alliance creates unified training standards that preserve the diversity of martial arts traditions while ensuring compatibility and mutual support between different schools and approaches. Shared resources are pooled in ways that would have been impossible under the old system of sectarian independence, allowing smaller groups to access techniques and knowledge that had previously been jealously guarded by larger organizations. Giving the [[Li Trading Company]]  sect a title of a sect and couple of simple cultivation techniques so they can defend themselves in exchange for help in managing and ever receiving resources like food and currency

Coordinated responses to threats become possible for the first time as the Martial Council develops communication networks and command structures that can respond rapidly to challenges anywhere within their sphere of influence. The fragmented and often contradictory responses that had characterized sectarian reactions to Royal persecution are replaced by unified strategies that leverage the combined strength of all participating groups.

**Part Three: Sacred Bonds**

Unlike their previous loose cooperation, this bond is formalized with blood oaths and sacred vows that cannot be easily broken, representing a level of commitment that goes far beyond the political agreements that had governed earlier alliances. These ceremonies draw upon the most solemn traditions of each participating sect, creating hybrid rituals that honor diverse spiritual practices while binding all participants to common cause.

The sects realize that their survival depends not on maintaining ancient rivalries, but on presenting a united front against a world that has grown hostile to their very existence, a recognition that requires them to fundamentally reconsider assumptions about identity, loyalty, and purpose that had shaped martial arts culture for centuries. The external threats they face prove so severe that internal divisions become not merely counterproductive but actively suicidal.

The formal nature of these commitments reflects the participants' understanding that half-measures and temporary expedients will not suffice to address the existential challenges they face. The blood oaths create personal bonds between leaders that transcend organizational loyalties, while the sacred vows invoke spiritual authorities that supersede human political calculations, making betrayal not merely dishonorable but spiritually damning.

**Part Four: Unity of Purpose**

For the first time since the demon war, they are truly one people with one purpose, united not by external threat but by shared identity and common cause that transcends the sectarian boundaries that had previously defined the martial arts world. This unity goes beyond mere military alliance to encompass cultural, educational, and spiritual dimensions that create a genuinely new form of social organization.

The transformation proves so complete that participants begin to think of themselves not as representatives of their individual sects but as members of a larger martial arts community that encompasses all legitimate practitioners regardless of their specific traditions or methodologies. This shift in identity has profound implications for how they relate to each other and to the outside world that had rejected them.

The unity forged through crisis proves more durable and meaningful than the cooperation that had existed during times of prosperity, as shared hardship creates bonds that mere common interest never could. The alliance members discover that their combined strength exceeds not just the sum of their individual capabilities but also the loose coordination they had achieved during the demon war, creating possibilities for action and influence that none had imagined possible under the old system of sectarian independence.

**Consequences:**Â The formation of the Martial Council represents the most significant transformation in martial arts organization since the original founding of the major sects, creating a unified power structure capable of coordinating responses to threats while preserving the diversity that had always been the martial world's greatest strength. The alliance's success in overcoming ancient rivalries demonstrates that external pressure can forge bonds stronger than tradition, while the formal nature of their commitments ensures that this unity will persist beyond the immediate crisis that created it. The unified front presents both Jeong Dynasty and criminal elements with an opponent far more formidable than any they had faced during the period of sectarian fragmentation, fundamentally altering the balance of power throughout the realm. The Martial Council's establishment marks the beginning of a new era in which martial artists operate as a coherent political and military force rather than as independent groups, setting the stage for direct confrontation with the Royal system that had rejected them.
