**Chapter V: Mandate of Heaven (1501-1502)** The breaking point arrives with an Royal decree that shocks the realm: martial arts are banned within Royal borders, and all martial artists are forbidden from entering the Jeong Dynasty's territory. The justification is framed in terms of "public safety" and "Royal security," but everyone understands the real message - the Jeong Dynasty no longer wants the sects' help or presence. Centuries of cooperation, shared sacrifice, and mutual respect are severed with a single proclamation. Ancient agreements are voided, joint training programs are dissolved, and sect representatives are expelled from court. The sects, who lost countless members defending Royal cities, are now treated as foreign threats. The Jeong Dynasty, drunk on paranoia and false confidence, believes it can maintain order through bureaucracy and conventional forces alone. The decree ignites outrage among both sects and common people who remember who truly saved them.

**Chapter V: Mandate of Heaven (1501-1502)**

The accumulated paranoia, corruption, and institutional decay of the preceding years reaches its inevitable crescendo with an Royal decree that reverberates through the realm like a thunderclap, fundamentally altering the relationship between the Jeong Dynasty and those who had bled to preserve it. What emerges from the palace is not merely a policy change but a complete repudiation of the bonds forged in the crucible of existential crisis, a declaration that transforms allies into enemies through the stroke of an Royal pen and the weight of accumulated fear and suspicion.

**Part One: The Proclamation of Betrayal**

The breaking point arrives with an Royal decree that shocks the realm: martial arts are banned within Royal borders, and all martial artists are forbidden from entering the Jeong Dynasty's territory, regardless of their previous service or current allegiances. The proclamation spreads through the provinces like wildfire, carried by Royal messengers who deliver the news with the same ceremonial gravity once reserved for declarations of war against foreign enemies, though in this case the enemy is declared to be those who had once been the Jeong Dynasty's most devoted defenders.
The justification is framed in terms of "public safety" and "Royal security," wrapped in legal language that speaks of "unregulated military forces" and "threats to civil order," but everyone understands the real message - the Jeong Dynasty no longer wants the sects' help or presence and views their very existence as incompatible with Royal authority. The decree presents itself as a measured response to legitimate security concerns, but its sweeping nature and absolute terms reveal the depth of the court's transformation from gratitude to hostility.
Royal officials who draft the proclamation convince themselves they are protecting the realm from internal threats, but the document they produce reads more like a declaration of war against the Jeong Dynasty's own protectors than a reasonable security measure. The language employed deliberately echoes the terminology once used to describe demonic threats, linguistically equating the Jeong Dynasty's saviors with the very forces they had sacrificed to defeat.

**Part Two: The Erasure of History**

Centuries of cooperation, shared sacrifice, and mutual respect are severed with a single proclamation that attempts to rewrite the fundamental narrative of the Jeong Dynasty's survival and prosperity. Ancient agreements negotiated in good faith during times of mutual need are voided without compensation or consideration, their carefully crafted terms dismissed as irrelevant to the Jeong Dynasty's current security needs and political calculations.
Joint training programs that had strengthened both Royal forces and sect capabilities are dissolved immediately, their participants scattered and their accumulated knowledge deliberately dispersed to prevent any continuation of the collaborative relationships that had proven so effective during the crisis. Royal officers who had learned advanced techniques through sect instruction find themselves forbidden from practicing or teaching what they had learned, while sect disciples who had served in Royal units are expelled from military service regardless of their records or dedication.
Sect representatives who had maintained diplomatic relations with the court for generations are expelled from the capital with barely enough time to gather their possessions, their centuries-old embassies closed and their staffs declared persona non grata. The accumulated protocols, relationships, and institutional knowledge that had facilitated cooperation between Jeong Dynasty and sects are deliberately destroyed, as if the Royal government seeks to erase any evidence that such cooperation had ever existed or proven beneficial.

**Part Three: The Ingratitude of Power**

The sects, who lost countless members defending Royal cities during the darkest hours of the demonic war, are now treated as foreign threats whose very presence within Royal borders constitutes an act of aggression against the state. Warriors who had died holding the walls of Royal fortresses find their sacrifices reframed as suspicious activities, while survivors who had expected gratitude and respect instead face exile and persecution from the very people they had protected.
The Jeong Dynasty, drunk on paranoia and false confidence generated by years of factional conflict and corrupt governance, believes it can maintain order through bureaucracy and conventional forces alone, despite overwhelming evidence that these same institutions have already proven inadequate to govern the expanded realm effectively. Royal planners convince themselves that the removal of sect influence will somehow restore the efficiency and control that the Jeong Dynasty had possessed before its expansion, ignoring the reality that the sects had never been the source of the Jeong Dynasty's governmental problems.
The decree reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the Jeong Dynasty's own capabilities and limitations, born from the court's isolation from the practical realities of governance and defense. Officials who have spent years focused on palace intrigue and factional competition have lost touch with the actual challenges facing the realm, creating policies based on their fears rather than genuine strategic assessment of the Jeong Dynasty's needs and resources.

**Part Four: The Kindling of Rebellion**

The decree ignites outrage among both sects and common people who remember who truly saved them when the demons threatened to destroy everything they held dear. In provinces where sect warriors had made the difference between survival and annihilation, the Royal proclamation is received not as legitimate policy but as profound betrayal that calls into question the Jeong Dynasty's moral authority and practical wisdom.
Common citizens who had witnessed sect heroism firsthand find themselves caught between Royal law and personal loyalty, creating a crisis of legitimacy that spreads throughout the realm as people are forced to choose between legal obedience and moral conviction. The Jeong Dynasty's attempt to eliminate sect influence instead galvanizes opposition to Royal authority among populations who had previously viewed the government as legitimate and beneficial.
Provincial governors who must enforce the decree discover that doing so requires them to act against the wishes and interests of their own populations, creating conflicts between Royal loyalty and effective governance that many resolve by passive resistance or outright defiance. The Jeong Dynasty's command structure begins to fracture as the gap between Royal policy and practical necessity becomes impossible to bridge through normal administrative channels.

**Key Locations:**

- The Crimson Throne Room: where the martial arts ban decree was signed
- The Palace of Whispers: Royal intelligence headquarters coordinating sect surveillance
- The Golden Archive: where ancient sect-Jeong Dynasty treaties were formally voided
- Sect Embassy Quarter: diplomatic district cleared of all martial artist representatives
- The Iron Gates: ceremonial entrance where sect diplomats were expelled
- Provincial notification centers: where the decree was publicly proclaimed

**Key Characters:**

- Emperor Zhao Tianming: paranoid ruler who signed the martial arts ban
- Grand Chancellor Liu Weiming: chief architect of the anti-sect decree
- General Wu Yangming: military leader convinced sects threatened army discipline
- Master Feng Qingshan: expelled sect diplomat, former Royal advisor for 30 years
- Captain Chen Baixi: Royal guard conflicted about enforcing the ban
- Scholar-Administrator Wang Jeonggwei: court historian tasked with erasing sect contributions from records

**Consequences:** The martial arts ban represents the Jeong Dynasty's complete transformation from protector to oppressor, destroying the moral foundation upon which Royal authority had rested since the demon war. The decree creates active enemies from former allies while demonstrating to all observers that Royal gratitude extends only as long as political convenience allows. The policy proves impossible to enforce effectively given the Jeong Dynasty's limited resources and widespread popular opposition, undermining Royal authority while failing to achieve its stated security objectives. The proclamation marks the point of no return in the relationship between Jeong Dynasty and sects, transforming a manageable political problem into an existential conflict that will consume both sides. The Jeong Dynasty's attempt to eliminate perceived threats instead creates actual enemies far more dangerous than the imagined conspiracies that inspired the ban, setting the stage for the open warfare that will tear the realm apart.
