**Chapter IV: Webs of Influence (1499-1501)** Desperate to maintain control over both expanded territories and powerful sects, the Jeong Dynasty resorts to increasingly questionable methods. Secret deals are struck with criminal organizations to police areas the military cannot effectively patrol. Human trafficking flourishes under Royal protection as officials turn blind eyes in exchange for bribes and information networks. Harsh treaties are forced upon weaker neighbors, demanding tribute and hostages while offering little protection in return. The Jeong Dynasty leverages debts against struggling regions, essentially enslaving entire populations to Royal interests. Underground markets in forbidden goods become state-sanctioned enterprises, their profits funding the Jeong Dynasty's shadow operations. The moral authority earned through the demon war is bartered away piece by piece for temporary political advantage.

As the Jeong Dynasty's traditional mechanisms of control prove inadequate to manage both its sprawling territorial expansion and the perceived threat of independent sects, the Royal government descends into increasingly desperate measures that would have been unthinkable during the moral clarity of the demonic war. What emerges is a shadow system of governance that operates through corruption, coercion, and collaboration with the very elements of society that the Jeong Dynasty had once sought to eliminate. The administration that had once prided itself on justice and order now finds itself dependent on the darkest aspects of human nature to maintain its grip on power.

**Part One: Partnerships with Darkness**

Desperate to maintain control over both expanded territories and powerful sects, the Jeong Dynasty resorts to increasingly questionable methods that fundamentally alter the nature of Royal governance. Officials who once prosecuted criminals now find themselves negotiating partnerships with the same organizations they had previously sought to destroy, creating an uneasy alliance between law and lawlessness that serves neither justice nor stability.

Secret deals are struck with criminal organizations to police areas the military cannot effectively patrol, transforming bandits into unofficial Royal agents whose methods remain brutal but whose targets now serve state interests. These arrangements begin as temporary expedients in the most remote provinces, where Royal forces are stretched too thin to maintain order, but gradually spread throughout the Jeong Dynasty as officials discover the convenience of having enforcers who operate outside legal constraints.

The criminal underworld, once a persistent threat to Royal stability, becomes an integral part of the governance structure as officials learn to channel criminal energy toward their own ends. Smuggling networks become unofficial intelligence services, protection rackets transform into tax collection systems, and territorial disputes between gangs evolve into proxy conflicts that serve Royal strategic interests without official Royal involvement.

**Part Two: The Currency of Human Misery**

Human trafficking flourishes under Royal protection as officials turn blind eyes in exchange for bribes and information networks that prove invaluable for maintaining control over increasingly restless populations. What begins as isolated incidents of corruption gradually becomes systematic exploitation as administrators discover that the trade in human beings provides both financial resources and intelligence capabilities that traditional governance methods cannot match.
Officials who once protected the vulnerable now profit from their exploitation, creating a parallel economy built on human suffering that operates with implicit Royal sanction. The same shipping networks that move legitimate trade goods begin carrying human cargo, while the documentation systems designed to track citizens become tools for processing slaves and identifying potential victims for trafficking operations.
The Jeong Dynasty's moral authority, earned through protecting its people from demonic threats, erodes as that same government becomes complicit in threats that emerge from human greed and cruelty. Provincial administrators who struggle to fund their operations through legitimate taxation discover that permitting and taxing illegal activities provides far more reliable revenue streams than attempting to govern through traditional means.

**Part Three: Diplomatic Extortion**

Harsh treaties are forced upon weaker neighbors, demanding tribute and hostages while offering little protection in return, as the Jeong Dynasty abandons its traditional role as regional stabilizer in favor of becoming a predatory overlord that exploits rather than protects. These agreements, negotiated through threats rather than mutual benefit, create a network of resentful client states whose loyalty extends only as far as Royal military reach.
The Jeong Dynasty leverages debts against struggling regions, essentially enslaving entire populations to Royal interests through financial manipulation that proves more effective than military conquest. Regions that borrowed Royal gold for reconstruction after the demonic war find themselves trapped in cycles of debt that require them to surrender increasing amounts of autonomy and resources to their supposed protectors.
These economic entanglements create a web of dependencies that extends Royal influence far beyond its borders while generating the resentment and instability that will eventually threaten that same influence. Neighboring kingdoms that had once viewed the Jeong Dynasty as a reliable ally now regard it as an existential threat that must be contained or destroyed before it consumes them entirely.

**Part Four: The Institutionalization of Corruption**

Underground markets in forbidden goods become state-sanctioned enterprises, their profits funding the Jeong Dynasty's shadow operations while creating a parallel economy that operates according to entirely different moral principles than the official Royal system. The same government that had once fought to protect its people from demonic corruption now profits from distributing substances and services that corrupt in different but equally destructive ways.
The moral authority earned through the demon war is bartered away piece by piece for temporary political advantage as officials discover that expedient solutions often require abandoning the principles that had made those solutions necessary in the first place. Each compromise makes the next one easier, creating a cascade of ethical degradation that transforms the nature of Royal governance
Royal institutions that had been built to serve justice and protect the innocent become mechanisms for exploitation and control, their original purposes subverted by the practical demands of maintaining power over an Jeong Dynasty that has grown beyond the capacity of its moral foundations to support. The transformation occurs gradually enough that each individual decision seems reasonable, but collectively they represent a fundamental abandonment of everything the Jeong Dynasty had claimed to represent.

**Consequences:** The Jeong Dynasty's descent into systematic corruption and collaboration with criminal elements creates a governance structure that is fundamentally unstable and morally bankrupt. While these methods provide short-term solutions to immediate problems, they generate long-term threats that will prove far more dangerous than the challenges they were meant to address. The network of criminal partnerships creates competing power centers that will eventually challenge Royal authority, while the systematic exploitation of both citizens and neighbors generates the resentment that fuels rebellion and foreign intervention. The Jeong Dynasty's moral authority, once its greatest source of legitimacy, disappears entirely as the government becomes indistinguishable from the threats it had once protected against. The shadow system of governance creates dependencies that will prove impossible to abandon, trapping the Jeong Dynasty in cycles of corruption and violence that make reform increasingly impossible and collapse increasingly inevitable.
