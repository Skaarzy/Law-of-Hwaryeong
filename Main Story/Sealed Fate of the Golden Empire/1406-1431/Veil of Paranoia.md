**Chapter III: Veil of Paranoia (1497-1499)** Fear of the sects' unchecked power spreads through the Royal court like wildfire. Corrupt officials, seeking to redirect attention from their own failures, whisper poison into willing ears about the "dangerous" martial artists who "saved" the Jeong Dynasty only to control it from the shadows. Wild rumors circulate: sects are building secret armies, hoarding mystical weapons, or planning to overthrow the government they helped preserve. Every act of sect independence is interpreted as defiance, every display of martial skill as a threat. The very people who bled alongside Royal soldiers are now painted as enemies within. Court officials inflate minor disputes into existential threats, turning heroes into villains through carefully crafted lies and manufactured evidence. The Jeong Dynasty begins to fear the strength of its own saviors.

In the suffocating atmosphere of factional mistrust that has consumed the Royal court, fear of the sects' unchecked power spreads through the palace corridors like wildfire, consuming rational thought and transforming gratitude into terror. What had once been celebrated as the Jeong Dynasty's salvation during the demonic war now becomes reframed as a Trojan horse that threatens to destroy the very civilization it had preserved. The martial sects, whose disciples had stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Royal soldiers against otherworldly horror, find themselves cast as the new existential threat in a narrative carefully crafted by those who seek to exploit the court's newfound appetite for suspicion and scapegoating.

**Part One: The Architects of Fear**

Corrupt officials, seeking to redirect attention from their own failures in governing the sprawling Jeong Dynasty, whisper poison into willing ears about the "dangerous" martial artists who "saved" the Jeong Dynasty only to control it from the shadows. Administrative failures in distant provinces, military incompetence among regular forces, and the general inability to manage the Jeong Dynasty's unwieldy expansion all become convenient targets for deflection when blame can be shifted to sect interference and manipulation.
These officials discover that blaming the sects provides the perfect scapegoat for their own inadequacies while simultaneously offering a unifying enemy that all factions can rally against. The court's fractured political groups find they can temporarily set aside their mutual suspicions when focused on this shared threat, creating a rare moment of unity built entirely on manufactured fear and carefully cultivated resentment.
The transformation proves remarkably swift as officials who had personally witnessed sect heroism during the war now find it politically expedient to reinterpret those same actions through a lens of suspicion. Heroic sacrifices become calculated manipulations, selfless service becomes elaborate deception, and the bonds forged in battle become evidence of dangerous infiltration that threatens the Jeong Dynasty's very foundations.

**Part Two: The Machinery of Slander**

Wild rumors circulate through the palace like a plague of whispered madness: sects are building secret armies in mountain strongholds, hoarding mystical weapons capable of leveling cities, or planning to overthrow the government they helped preserve through a coordinated uprising timed for the Jeong Dynasty's moment of greatest weakness. Each rumor builds upon the last, creating an increasingly elaborate conspiracy theory that attributes every Royal failure to sect manipulation and interference.
Court officials inflate minor disputes into existential threats with the practiced skill of experienced propagandists. When sects refuse Royal demands that conflict with their traditional practices, this becomes evidence of territorial ambitions. When martial schools maintain their independence despite pressure to integrate into Royal hierarchy, this transforms into proof of deliberate military preparation for rebellion against the state.
The very independence that had made the sects effective allies during the crisis now becomes reframed as dangerous defiance of Royal authority. Their refusal to abandon centuries-old traditions and submit completely to Royal control, which had once been respected as necessary for maintaining their unique abilities, now appears as evidence of divided loyalty and treasonous intent that threatens the Jeong Dynasty's stability.

**Part Three: Heroes Become Villains**

The very people who bled alongside Royal soldiers are now painted as enemies within through a systematic campaign of character assassination that would have been impossible during the immediate aftermath of the war. Sect warriors whose techniques had saved entire cities from demonic assault find themselves accused of using those same abilities to spy on Royal activities and undermine government authority.
Court historians begin quietly revising official records of the war, subtly diminishing sect contributions while emphasizing their "suspicious" behavior during crucial moments. Heroic last stands where sect warriors had held defensive lines become recharacterized as calculated gambits to force the Jeong Dynasty into their debt. Miraculous healing provided by sect physicians transforms into evidence of dangerous knowledge that could be used to poison rather than cure.
Personal relationships between court officials and sect members, once sources of pride and mutual respect, become liabilities that must be hidden or actively denounced. Officials who had formed genuine friendships with martial artists during the war find themselves forced to choose between their careers and their consciences, with most choosing the safer path of public denunciation and private regret.

**Part Four: The Jeong Dynasty Devours Its Protectors**

Court officials manufacture evidence and craft elaborate lies that transform every aspect of sect behavior into proof of malevolent intent against the Royal government. Training exercises become military preparations for rebellion, charitable work becomes intelligence gathering operations, and traditional sect secrecy about techniques becomes evidence of hidden conspiracies against the state and its legitimate authority.
The Jeong Dynasty begins to fear the strength of its own saviors with an intensity that borders on madness, creating an atmosphere where rational assessment becomes impossible and every interaction with sect members is viewed through the lens of potential betrayal. Officials compete to demonstrate their loyalty by discovering new evidence of sect perfidy, leading to increasingly elaborate fabrications and paranoid interpretations of innocent activities.
The Royal intelligence apparatus, once focused on external threats, turns its full attention to monitoring and undermining the very people who had enabled its survival. Surveillance networks established to track demonic infiltration are repurposed to spy on sect activities, creating detailed files on individuals whose only crime was having risked their lives for the Jeong Dynasty's preservation. The machinery of security becomes the machinery of persecution as fear overwhelms gratitude and suspicion replaces wisdom.

**Key Locations:**

- The Rumor Mills: palace tea houses where officials spread fabricated sect intelligence
- Sect monitoring stations: former demon-watch posts now used to spy on martial artists
- The Revision Archives: where official war records are being quietly altered
- Isolated sect compounds: martial schools now viewed as potential rebel strongholds
- The Whispering Gardens: where court officials meet to coordinate anti-sect propaganda
- Border fortresses: where sect-trained guards face suspicion from their own commanders

**Key Characters:**

- Minister Chen Wei: administrative failure using sect blame to cover his incompetence
- General Marcus Valerius: military leader threatened by sect influence over his troops
- Master Liu Jian: Crimson Lotus defender now accused of using protection magic for espionage
- Grandmaster Elena Stormwind: aerial reconnaissance expert facing allegations of foreign collaboration
- Court Historian Wang Ming: official quietly revising war records to diminish sect contributions
- Captain Sarah Blackwood: Royal officer torn between loyalty to sect friends and career survival
- Spymaster Liu Zhang: intelligence chief redirecting resources from external to internal "threats"


**Consequences:** The court's transformation of sect heroes into perceived enemies creates a dangerous precedent for how the Jeong Dynasty treats those who serve it faithfully but maintain independent power. The systematic campaign of slander and suspicion destroys the trust between the Royal government and its most capable defenders, leaving the Jeong Dynasty vulnerable to threats that its regular forces cannot handle alone. The paranoia spreads beyond the court to military units and provincial administrators, creating a climate where competence becomes suspect and independence equals treason. The Jeong Dynasty's strength begins eating itself as fear overwhelms gratitude, setting the stage for the open persecution that will drive the sects from willing cooperation to desperate resistance. The very qualities that made the sects effective against demonic threats - their independence, skill, and loyalty to principles rather than personalities - become reframed as existential dangers to Royal authority.
