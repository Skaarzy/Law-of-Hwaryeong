**Chapter VI: Rot Within A Jade (Years 1354-1356)** The emperor issues a decree declaring total war on demonic infiltration. A systematic purge begins - any cultist found shall be executed regardless of rank. The discoveries are horrifying - governors with demonic shrines, court officials funding cults, respected merchants revealed as demon worshipers. The Jeong Dynasty bleeds as it cuts out the corruption, but the alternative is collapse.

The emperor, finally accepting the gravity of the situation, issues an Royal decree that sends shockwaves through the Jeong Dynasty. Official messengers ride to every major sect, bearing the Royal seal and a chilling proclamation: demonic cultists have infiltrated the highest levels of government and society.
The decree is absolute - any person found practicing demonic cultivation or worshiping demon entities shall be executed immediately, regardless of their rank, wealth, or connections. No exceptions for nobles, no mercy for officials, no protection for the wealthy. The Jeong Dynasty has declared total war on the corruption within its own ranks.
What follows is a purge unlike anything in recent history. Royal investigators, backed by sect members, begin systematically examining court officials, wealthy merchants, and local magistrates. The signs they look for are subtle but damning - unusual financial transactions, unexplained absences, strange scars or markings, and most tellingly, the red-eyed stare that witnesses had reported.
The discoveries are horrifying. A provincial governor is found with demonic symbols carved into his study walls. A high-ranking court official's mansion contains a hidden shrine dedicated to dark entities. Respected merchants are revealed to be funding cult activities across multiple provinces.
Each arrest reveals more names, more connections. The corruption runs deeper than anyone imagined - some cultists had been in positions of power for years, slowly undermining the Jeong Dynasty from within while appearing as loyal citizens.
The Jeong Dynasty bleeds as it cuts out the rot, but the alternative is total collapse.


**Chapter VI: Rot Within A Jade (Years 1381-1398)**

**Part One: The Royal Decree**

The emperor, finally forced to confront the scope of the crisis, issues an Royal decree that reverberates across the Jeong Dynasty like thunder. Official messengers bearing the Royal seal ride to every major sect, every provincial capital, every military garrison with a proclamation that changes everything: demonic cultists have infiltrated the highest levels of government and society.
The decree is absolute and merciless - any person found practicing demonic cultivation or worshipping demonic entities shall be executed immediately, regardless of rank, wealth, or connections. No exceptions for nobles, no mercy for court officials, no protection for wealthy merchants. The Golden Sun Emperor has declared total war on the corruption festering within his own Jeong Dynasty.

**Part Two: The Great Purge Begins**

Royal investigators, now backed by sect members and given unprecedented authority, begin systematically examining every level of society. They start with court officials, wealthy merchants, and local magistrates, but their net quickly widens to include anyone in positions of influence or power.
The signs they search for are subtle but damning: unusual financial transactions that can't be explained, unexplained absences during key dates, strange scars or ritual markings hidden beneath clothing, and most tellingly, the red-eyed stare that witnesses had reported from the hooded figures. They also look for possession of forbidden texts, unusual artifacts, and connections to areas where corruption has been detected.

**Part Three: Horrifying Discoveries**

The discoveries shake the Jeong Dynasty to its foundations. A provincial governor is found with demonic symbols carved directly into his study walls, hidden behind expensive tapestries. His mansion's basement contains evidence of ritual sacrifices - bloodstains that won't wash clean and bones arranged in ceremonial patterns.
A high-ranking court official's estate reveals a hidden shrine dedicated to dark entities, complete with offerings of gold, precious gems, and disturbingly, human hair and teeth. His financial records show years of payments to mysterious beneficiaries across multiple provinces.
Respected merchants who had funded temples and charity works are revealed to be channeling money to cult activities. Their trade routes perfectly match the locations where caravans had vanished and corruption had spread.

**Part Four: The Web Unravels**

Each arrest reveals more names, more connections, more horror. The corruption runs deeper than anyone had imagined - some cultists had been in positions of power for decades, slowly undermining Royal authority while appearing as model citizens. They had used their influence to redirect resources, suppress investigations, and protect fellow cultists from scrutiny.
The purge becomes a cascade of revelations. Lower-ranking officials confess under interrogation, revealing their superiors. Merchants provide lists of customers and partners. Even some sect members are found to have been compromised, creating a crisis of trust that threatens the very foundations of the investigation.

**Key Locations:**

- Royal palace and court chambers
- Provincial governor mansions and offices
- Hidden shrines in noble estates
- Merchant trading houses and warehouses
- Sect headquarters conducting internal purges
- Execution grounds across the Jeong Dynasty
- Royal prisons overflowing with suspects

**Key Characters:**

- The emperor issuing unprecedented decrees
- Royal investigators with expanded authority
- Sect members joining the purge
- Corrupt officials and merchants being exposed
- Loyal citizens reporting suspicious neighbors
- Executioners working day and night
- Terrified nobles wondering who will be next

**Consequences:** The Jeong Dynasty bleeds as it cuts out the rot, but the alternative is total collapse. Government functions slow as officials are arrested or flee. Trade disrupts as merchant networks are dismantled. Trust evaporates as neighbors turn on neighbors. Yet for the first time in years, the Jeong Dynasty is fighting back against the corruption instead of ignoring it. The question remains: will they cut out the rot in time, or has it spread too far to stop?
