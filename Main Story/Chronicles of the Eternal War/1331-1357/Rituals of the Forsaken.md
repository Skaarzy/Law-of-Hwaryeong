**Chapter III: Rituals of the Forsaken (Years 1348-1351)** After a decade of subtle signs, the Monthly yearly Council Royal meetings become as each clan finds weird things happening more and more Han now finding debts that haven't been paid and were forgive with unknown reasons for forgiving the debt and even some of their colleagues go missing ,baek now finding fish and water animal with rotten parts of their body that are still alive some even having bone sticking out and swimming like nothing is wrong and that the fish population has decreased massively, in the end none are able to convince the Jeong Dynasty to notify the sects of this mysterious activities
After a decade of the Jeong Dynasty being at its high and ignoring threats and mysterious things that happen in the provinces of the 5 clans and it started even in their own province, all of it comes to a boiling point in the yearly Royal council with the 5 sects yelling at the ministers of Royal court and at the emperor himself, but in the end nothing was achieved because the emperor didn’t want to involve the powerful sects into these small matters. It would just sully his image as a golden sun emperor who led a decade of a prospering Jeong Dynasty, so he just tells them to go back and threatens the clans. If they alert the sect, he personally will lead an army to fight the 5 clans.

Part 1 :
While the Jeong Dynasty celebrates another year of prosperity, the shadows are growing stronger in the provinces of the 5 clans. Now  these things are clearly influenced by some kind of spells or curses — clearly an evil doing by someone or something — the clans try to make by with all that is happening.
Baek struggles with rotten fish, sharks, and other marine life that is still alive even though you can see their skeletons. Poisoning because of eating these fish.  
Han is missing more and more people and debt collectors. Also, the debts disappearing and new unknown ones appear at this stage, even more than before.  
Song finds actual people in robes doing what seems like rituals with blood.  
Yu is seeing more and more corrupted animals — almost like they have gone rabid — and they have increased power and speed, which is slowly ruining the whole forest of the Yu clan.  
Jang is now seeing at their performances people that are discussing things like murders and sacrifices in the open like it’s no secret, and even some of their performers have been killed and almost put up as trophies on trees.

Part 2 :
 The yearly Royal Council’s date has been pushed forward because the 5 clans are full of rage and anger towards the Emperor. This time, when the 5 clans arrive, they aren't welcomed with open arms, but at the entrance of the Royal Council Hall, there are at least a hundred guards. This angers the clans even more — that the Jeong Dynasty is treating them as prisoners — but they keep calm because they really need to sort things for each of their provinces, and for that, they need the help of the Jeong Dynasty, more precisely help from the Emperor.

So after a couple of useless hours of begging and deliberating, the clans' calm demeanor vanishes, and the clan leaders start yelling at the Royal Council members for just ignoring them and not even sending word to the sect — like the Divine Seal Sect — to send at least a couple of inner disciples to each province. But this angers the Emperor, and he makes them leave and threatens war if they even try to contact any sect.

Part 3 :
In the end the clans leave defeated by the emperor and his threats they fear if they do reach out to a sect then their situation might become worse than it is all the clan heads decide to leave the Royal city with a concerned thought on their mind what if all of these mysterious things keep getting worse and escalate to the point of villages starving or whole population which gets poisoned and dies and creates a plague , but all that the clans can do is worry , in the end they began changing their provinces' rules gathering most people at bigger places so they can help all , tried selling parts of their province to others just so they can survive and in the end they managed to pull it off and survive

Consequences :
Even though the clans managed to survive with a lot of sacrifice and death which made them furious at the Jeong Dynasty but just when they were about to complain and issue a war a big rumor starts spreading around one that none believed but seemed true that rumor was so impossible that the sect and the Jeong Dynasty did react but mildly all of them thinking it's probably a simple disagreement and an accidental death But the clans knew it was true and they trembled in fear, praying to all known deities that its not true.
