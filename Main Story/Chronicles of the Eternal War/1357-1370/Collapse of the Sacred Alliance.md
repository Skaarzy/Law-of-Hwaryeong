**Chapter VI: Collapse of the Sacred Alliance (1364-1370)** With the immediate demonic threat ended, the fragile bonds that held the alliance together begin to snap. Old rivalries resurface as different factions blame each other for the war's devastating cost. The sects, having sacrificed their land with so many people dead just because the dead emperor didn't act faster, feel guilty and seek to pull themselves together through isolation from the Jeong Dynasty. The Jeong Dynasty, weakened and paranoid, views the powerful sects as potential threats to what little authority remains. Bitter arguments over resources, territory, and honor tear apart relationships forged in blood. The alliance that saved the world destroys itself in peace, leaving everyone weaker and more vulnerable than before.


**Part One: The Poison of Blame**

Old rivalries resurface with venomous intensity as different factions begin to assign responsibility for the war's devastating cost. What had been set aside in the face of extinction now returns magnified by grief and loss. The sects blame the dead emperor for not informing them of the demonic threat early enough, arguing that if they had been warned and involved from the beginning, their combined knowledge could have prevented the catastrophe entirely. They point to their destroyed monasteries, lost traditions, and dead masters as evidence of what Royal secrecy and arrogance had cost the world.
Royal survivors counter that the emperor had made the ultimate sacrifice to save them all, and that questioning his decisions dishonors his memory. They argue that the sects' traditional isolation and refusal to work with Royal authorities had made early cooperation impossible, and that their withdrawal from the Jeong Dynasty's affairs had left the throne with no choice but to handle the crisis alone.
The arguments become increasingly bitter as each group catalogs their sacrifices and finds them unequal. The sects insist that their losses were unnecessary, that proper warning would have allowed them to prepare defenses and preserve their ancient knowledge. Royal forces maintain that the emperor's sacrifice bought them the time needed to forge the alliances that ultimately won the war, and that the sects' current complaints prove they never truly understood the scope of the threat.

**Part Two: The Great Withdrawal**

The sects, having sacrificed their sacred lands and watched so many of their people die, feel a crushing guilt that manifests as bitter resentment toward the Royal system. They reason that if the dead emperor had acted faster, had taken the demonic threat seriously before it became a crisis requiring his ultimate sacrifice, their ancient traditions might have survived intact. The emperor's heroic death, while opening the path to eventual victory, came too late to prevent the destruction of irreplaceable knowledge, holy sites, and entire lineages.
Surviving masters see their life's work reduced to ash and blame the Royal system's initial failure to recognize and respond to the threat. If the warnings had been heeded sooner, if the Jeong Dynasty had mobilized before the situation became desperate enough to require the emperor's sacrifice, perhaps the war could have been won without such devastating losses to the martial arts world.

**Part Three: Royal Paranoia**

The Jeong Dynasty, weakened by years of war views the powerful sects as potential threats to what little authority remains. Royal advisors, seeing how effectively the martial arts masters had fought against the demons, begin to worry about what would happen if that same power were turned against the throne. The very skills that had saved the Jeong Dynasty now seem like weapons pointed at its heart.His son now the new emperor tried and somewhat succeeded in calming the people and organizing the situations of rescue and in his first decree he gave the people the new plan of how the Royal city would look with a new region over the old center which had a busily market now a fortress for the emperor and his servants which didn't make people happy even though it was with good intentions.But now matter what the emperor did or what decree he issued some officials were paranoid and spread rumors about sect masters plotting rebellion, claiming that their withdrawal from cooperation is actually preparation for war against Royal authority. They point to the closed sect territories as evidence of secret military preparations and interpret the sects' refusal to train Royal soldiers as proof of hostile intentions.
The weakened Royal court, desperate to maintain control over territories that barely acknowledge their authority, begins to see the alliance as a mistake that gave too much power to groups that were traditionally kept in check. Orders are issued demanding that sects submit to Royal oversight, that their training be regulated, and that their territories be opened to Royal inspection - demands that would have been unthinkable during the war but now seem necessary for Royal survival.

**Part Four: The Severing of Bonds**

Bitter arguments over resources, territory, and honor tear apart relationships that had been forged in blood and tempered by shared sacrifice. Disputes that had been set aside during the war now become irreconcilable conflicts as each faction fights for what they see as their rightful share of the victory's spoils.
Territory that had been jointly liberated becomes contested ground as different groups claim exclusive rights based on their sacrifices. Resources that had been shared freely during the war are now hoarded jealously, with each faction convinced that the others are taking more than their fair share. Honor, that most precious commodity in a world where material wealth has little meaning, becomes the subject of endless debates about who deserves credit for which victories.
The alliance that saved the world destroys itself in peace, leaving everyone weaker and more vulnerable than before. Former allies refuse to speak to each other, joint training programs are abandoned, and the coordinated response systems that had been so effective against the demons are dismantled through mutual mistrust.
Veterans who had fought together watch in horror as their leaders tear apart everything they had built. The unity that had been their greatest weapon against the demons dissolves into a dozen different factions, each convinced that they alone understand the true cost of victory and that their former allies have betrayed the memory of those who died.In the end the emperor who had no choice of becoming a ruler did what he could , as fate would have it he couldn't see the fortress built but on his dying breaths the emperor issued his last decree that the new fortress shall be called the forbidden city, at his funereal and year after his death most called him a courpt and greed emperor who had no morality or cared for his people.

**Key Locations:**

- Closed sect territories barred to former allies
- Royal councils where sects refuse to participate
- Contested lands claimed by multiple factions
- Abandoned joint training facilities
- Border posts where former allies eye each other with suspicion
- Meeting halls where alliance agreements are formally dissolved

**Key Characters:**

- Sect masters withdrawing into bitter isolation
- Royal officials spreading paranoid theories
- Veterans watching their unity crumble
- Surviving nobles grasping for control
- Refugees caught between competing authorities
- Former alliance leaders unable to bridge the growing divide

**Consequences:** The dissolution of the Crimson Harmony leaves the Jeong Dynasty more fractured than it had been even during the demon war. Instead of one unified response to future threats, there are now dozens of suspicious factions, each guarding their secrets and viewing their former allies as potential enemies. The very success that had saved them from the demons becomes the foundation for new conflicts, as peace proves more destructive to their unity than war ever was. The Jeong Dynasty survives, but in a form so changed that it raises questions about whether what they saved was worth the cost of saving it.
