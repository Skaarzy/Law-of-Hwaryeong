It works like a **passive story feed**:

- The MC isn’t physically present in the other faction’s events, but key NPCs or messengers relay happenings through dialogue, letters, or reports.
- This preserves player knowledge, builds world depth, and reinforces the **illusion of a living, multi-faceted world**.
- It also adds tension: the player _knows_ problems exist, but can’t intervene, which emphasizes the stakes and the MC’s limited influence at that moment.

You can sprinkle in these reports via:
- Town gossip while wandering
- Letters, scrolls, or envoys arriving at your location
- Brief cutscene-style interludes or dialogue options
It’s a subtle way to keep the player informed, maintain immersion, and avoid padding or forced backtracking.

**Content Categories:**
1. **Current Events:** What’s happening in the other faction/region now.
2. **Consequences:** Outcomes of decisions or battles the MC didn’t witness.
3. **Warnings/Advice:** Potential dangers or opportunities without action options.
4. **Personalized Reactions:** Key NPCs’ thoughts/emotions about the events (adds emotional depth).

**Delivery Methods:**
- Dialogue popup (short scene with messenger/NPC)
- Letters or scrolls delivered via bird (readable at player’s leisure)
- Overheard NPC conversation during wandering
- Optional cutscenes (brief, non-interactive)

**Integration into Gameplay:**
- Passive feed doesn’t unlock new quests directly (unless already planned).
- Optional: give minor rewards (reputation, hints, resources) for checking or acting on info in your own region.
- Can be tagged to the **Quest Log / Story Progress UI** so players can track what they “know” vs. what they’ve personally experienced.

### **Flow Example (Text-Based)**
1. **MC finishes Province A quest** → triggers messenger arrival
2. **Messenger dialogue:** “Word comes from Sect X — a rebellion broke out near their border. We cannot intervene yet.”
3. **Update Story Log:** marks “Sect X rebellion” as known, unresolved
4. **MC continues wandering/exploring local quests**
5. **Later, MC returns to Province B** → new messenger report: consequences of previous events

---

This can **scale across both arcs**:
- Clan perspective sees reports from Sect regions
- Sect perspective sees reports from Royal/Clan regions

It keeps **world-altering events alive**, gives **context for the MC’s choices**, and avoids forcing the player to be everywhere physically.
