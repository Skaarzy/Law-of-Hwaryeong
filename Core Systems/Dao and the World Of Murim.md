## **Core Principle:**
**Too much of ANYTHING becomes its opposite - even "good" things become bad when taken to extremes.**

**How It Works:**
- **Too much good** → Turns bad (cultivating too much without release turns into Qi deviation)
- **Too little bad** → Also bad (always forgiving people and evil doers make evil flourish)
- **Balance** → Right action for the situation (help when needed, fight when necessary)

**Examples:**
- **Beating up bandits** = Good (protects innocents)
- **Never using violence** = Bad (lets evil spread)
- **Always using violence** = Bad (becomes tyranny)

**The Key:**
**Context matters more than actions.** The Dao doesn't care if you're "good" or "evil" - it cares if you're **appropriate** for the situation and maintaining natural balance.
**Your system = Practical wisdom over moral absolutes.**
**Much more realistic and game-friendly than traditional karma systems!**



## DAO
**Dao** (道 dào) – the origin and source of all things. It can be translated in _many_ different ways, including The Way / Road / Path / Method. According to Daoism, it is the absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of Yin and Yang and signifying the way, or code of behavior, that is in harmony with the natural order.
In the Joseon Dao framework, that would just be **how it works**. No explanation needed.
**The cosmic rules just say:**
- Deities can visit earth 
- But they have to use human bodies 
- And their powers get restricted 
- Why? Because that's just how the system operates 
**Nobody knows why** - not the deities, not humans, not anyone. It's just a fundamental rule of reality, like:
- Why does gravity pull down and not up?
- Why is water wet?
- **Why do deities need human bodies on earth?**

**Answer to all:** "That's just how it is."
**The Dao doesn't explain itself.** It's not a person with reasons or motivations. It's just the cosmic operating system, and apparently one of its features is "deities must use human avatars with limited power when visiting earth."
**No deeper meaning, no purpose, no story behind it.**
Just a built-in restriction that exists because **that's how reality is programmed to work.**
Very clean and simple - the kind of "it just is" explanation that fits the Joseon Neo-Confucian mindset perfectly.


## Ying & Yang
**Yin & Yang** (阴阳 yīnyáng) – the duality present in all aspects of the universe. For instance: **Yin** is Female / Soft / Death / Dark / the Moon, while **Yang** is Male / Hard / Life / Light / the Sun – the comparisons are endless. Yin & Yang describe how opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they mutually give rise to each other.
**Natural balance examples:**
- Too much aggression (yang) → Naturally creates situations requiring subtlety (yin)
- Too much hiding (yin) → Forces confrontation moments (yang)
- Overuse fire techniques (yang) → Body naturally needs water/ice techniques (yin)
- Too much solitude (yin) → Circumstances push you toward teamwork (yang)

**Not punishment - just natural rebalancing**
Like how being awake too long (yang) naturally makes you tired and need sleep (yin). The universe just works that way.

**Perfect for player choices:**
- Players can choose to go extreme in one direction
- But the world naturally creates situations that require the opposite
- Balanced players have more options and flexibility
- Extreme players face natural consequences that push them toward balance


## QI
**Qi = The Material Force/Energy of Everything**
**Qi** (气) – the vital energy which exists in all things.
- Qi is sometimes written as “Ki” or “Chi”. It can be translated in _many_ different ways, including Breath / Vital Breath / Vital Energy / Spiritual Energy. (etc…)
Li (principle), and Qi (psycho-physical force). Neo-Confucian scholars believed that all beings in the universe shared an "original nature" comprising all the principles in the world. 
It is the force and energy behind ... changes in the universe. With Li (generative, penetrating, coherent order, and unity), Qi (interactive, localized, physically diversifying energy)

**Simple Explanation:**
**Qi = The actual energy/matter that makes things happen** **Li = The rules/patterns that qi follows**

Think of it like:
- **Li** = The programming code
- **Qi** = The electricity that runs the program

**For Murim Game:**

**Qi in Joseon terms would be:**
- The actual **energy** martial artists use
- Follows **natural laws** (li/principles)
- Can be **cultivated and refined**
- Has **automatic consequences** when misused
- **Gets unbalanced** when you go against natural principles

**Perfect murim mechanics:**
- Qi naturally flows according to yin-yang balance
- Using qi against moral principles causes deviation/corruption
- Proper cultivation aligns your qi with cosmic principles
- Everyone has qi - but how you use it matters

**It's not mystical magic - it's the fundamental energy of reality that follows natural laws**, just like how Dao and yin-yang work in your system.
