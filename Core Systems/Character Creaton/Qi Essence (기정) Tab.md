Qi Cultivation (No UI)
- **Immersive Only**: Qi cultivation has **no visible UI** during meditation.
    
- The player sits and meditates in a peaceful room or their own land.
    
- Potions, pills, and tools are accessed through clicking a **table/altar**, which opens a small inventory UI.
    
- The actual growth in Qi happens **passively over time**, including offline when the player logs out  if theyâ€™re cultivating in a safe space.
    
- Visual or audio effects (like pulsing aura, glowing breath, wind effects) indicate Qi flow and progress instead of numbers or bars.

- **Basic Room**: Standard cultivation speed
- **Mountain Peak**: Faster qi absorption, wind effects
- **Cave/Grotto**: Deep meditation bonus, echo sounds
- **Spiritual Garden**: Healing qi bonus, flower petal effects
