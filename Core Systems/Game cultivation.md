The Dao is the natural, ever-present essence of the universe—like air—existing everywhere but controlling nothing. It connects all things without imposing rules.

[[All Deities]]  
Deities are supreme spiritual beings embodying fundamental forces or concepts like Time, War, Nature, Death, and more. Each deity has its own unique spiritual realm where they primarily reside. They may occasionally take human form to interact with the mortal world but generally remain within their realms.

[[Immortals]]
Immortals are martial masters who have achieved lifespans exceeding a century through by redirecting their pure life qi into a constant flow through their bodies, they halt physical aging entirely but slowly deplete their inner core's capacity over centuries. Recognizable by their changed eye color and perpetually growing hair and nails, these rare individuals have abandoned all worldly attachments to maintain the perfect qi control required to survive. Their enhanced meridians allow them to channel qi with exceptional efficiency. Only a handful exist across the murim world, living in isolation until their life qi runs out at approximately 350 years of age.

**The Strongest**  
Among humans, there are about 30 elite individuals known as **The Strongest**. These individuals possess immense qi and power, far beyond normal humans. Their perception of things around them and qi in general is sensitive to the point of them being able to sense t from far away with great detail of what amount of qi its is , like seeing a rabbit 50 meters away its called Qi Echo Traces.

**Normal Practitioners**  
Regular people who cultivate qi and meditate do not possess enough power to form their own spiritual realms. They focus solely on increasing their qi within the mortal plane, training and growing steadily but without access to realms or the vast power The Strongest wield.


## **Cultivation Mechanics**

**Meditation Requirements:**
- **Safe cultivation** requires being in your **family compound** or **designated training grounds**
- **Field cultivation** possible but leaves you vulnerable and provides 50% efficiency
- **Offline cultivation** works only in safe locations - character continues training while logged out
- **Resource consumption**: Pills, herbs, or special foods required for sustained cultivation
- **Daily limits**: Diminishing returns after 4-6 hours of active cultivation to prevent grinding

**Breakthrough System:**
- **Automatic progression** within stages through time/resources
- **Manual breakthroughs** required between major levels through specific challenges:
    - Combat trials, moral tests, or technique mastery
    - Clan elders' approval for higher levels
    - Pilgrimage to sacred sites for advanced stages

- **Balanced approach** adapting to situations provides optimal growth
- Moral choices during breakthroughs affect available techniques and paths

**Natural Consequences:**
- Violating Dao principles slows cultivation or blocks progression
- Appropriate action in context accelerates growth
- Extreme imbalance triggers automatic qi deviation events
