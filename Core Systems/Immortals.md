Achieving life beyond a century in the murim world requires three critical factors that make it exceptionally rare.
First, only those who reach the highest cultivation stages can even attempt it—roughly the top one percent of all martial artists. This level of inner core strength takes decades to achieve, and most practitioners never come close. Second, the process demands perfect qi control and mental discipline. The practitioner must continuously redirect a portion of their life qi—the pure essence within their inner core—to sustain their body past natural limits. This creates a constant drain that requires flawless regulation. Any lapse in concentration causes the core to destabilize, resulting in immediate death. Only masters with absolute technical precision can maintain this balance.
Third, it requires complete renunciation of worldly life. Like Buddhist monks purging impurities, immortality seekers must abandon family, wealth, comfort, and all emotional attachments. Because strong emotions cause distractions that disrupt qi flow and break the necessary concentration. The path demands total isolation and dedication to cultivation alone. Even meeting all these requirements doesn't guarantee success. Some individuals simply lack the right physiology—their cores cannot sustain the constant drain. Attempting the process kills them within days. There's no way to test compatibility beforehand. Once initiated, the process is irreversible. The inner core exists in two states: either the pure qi remains untouched and stable, or it flows in a constant, controlled drain to sustain immortality. Once that flow begins, it cannot be stopped. Attempting to halt or reverse the drain destabilizes the core entirely, like jamming a spinning wheel—the structure collapses and the practitioner dies instantly. The core cannot return to its original static state once altered. Upon achieving immortality, the practitioner's physical aging stops completely. Someone who reaches immortality at age 50 will look 50 for the next three centuries. Someone who waits until 90 remains frozen at that elderly appearance. This creates a difficult choice: attempt it younger with a more vigorous appearance but risk failure due to insufficient cultivation, or wait until power is certain but remain ancient-looking forever. The transformation leaves visible markers. The constant flow of pure qi through the bloodstream causes the eyes to change color, a permanent sign of their altered state. Hair, beards, and nails continue growing indefinitely, requiring regular maintenance. The body can still gain or lose weight, grow weak or strong through training or neglect, but any significant physical change risks disturbing the delicate flow of pure qi through blood and meridians—potentially fatal destabilization. However, immortality brings one significant advantage beyond extended life. As pure qi continuously travels through both blood vessels and meridians over decades and centuries, the meridians themselves evolve and strengthen. They expand their capacity, allowing the immortal to channel and release far more qi than they could before the transformation. This enhanced qi output partially compensates for the shrinking maximum capacity, making even diminished immortals formidable opponents.
As centuries pass, the life qi depletes irreversibly. Regular qi can still be cultivated, but maximum capacity shrinks over time. A 200-year-old might hold only 70% of their former power, dropping to 30% by age 300. However, even at 70% capacity, these immortals still rival most martial artists through sheer experience, refined technique, centuries of accumulated knowledge, and their evolved meridian systems. At 350 years, the life qi is exhausted and death comes regardless of cultivation level. This combination of factors ensures only a handful of immortals exist across the entire murim world at any time.

**The Two Paths of Death**
An immortal nearing the end of their centuries-long existence faces a final choice between two deaths. The first path is the qi transfer—a deliberate sacrifice for a chosen disciple. The master and student enter a ritual that spans approximately twelve hours, during which the master slowly channels their remaining life qi and all accumulated regular qi into the disciple's core. The transfer cannot be perfectly precise; roughly seventy to eighty percent successfully passes while the rest dissipates into nothing. Throughout these twelve hours, the master endures building displeasure and discomfort as their core begins its collapse. When the transfer completes, the destabilization happens rapidly—the master's core ruptures, blood spews from their mouth, and death comes in moments. The disciple emerges with centuries of cultivation compressed into their being, giving them a far greater chance of surviving their own attempt at immortality, though success is never guaranteed.

The second path is natural depletion, where the immortal chooses to retain their qi until the very end. As they approach three hundred and fifty years, the final year becomes a prolonged torment. With life qi nearly exhausted, pain becomes so overwhelming that the immortal must cultivate almost constantly—twenty-three hours out of every day—just to keep the agony bearable. This relentless meditation is the only thing standing between them and unbearable suffering. They retreat into complete seclusion, their existence reduced to an endless cycle of cultivation to preserve what little remains. When the last drop of life qi finally burns away, death comes peacefully, a quiet release after a year of endurance. The body, maintained through sheer discipline until the final moment, allows the spirit to depart in stillness rather than chaos.
