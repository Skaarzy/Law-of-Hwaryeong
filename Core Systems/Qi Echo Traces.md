**Qi Echo Traces** - Historical battlefields that MC wasn't there for can retain spiritual imprints of past conflicts which MC can witness once they reach the realm of master. Only masters can perceive these qi traces, as their sensitivity to qi is high, seeing battles as colored shadows (each color represents the color of that person's qi) that show the flow and intensity of combat and where and how much qi was released. Early game MC can only see physical destruction, but after becoming a master later, players can return to witness the full spiritual echoes, revealing the complete story of legendary battles by meditating and calmly trying to sense the battle.


- **Subtle glow or outline:** Targets emit a faint aura reflecting their qi signature. Strength determines brightness. Weak enemies are dim; strong enemies shine clearer.
- **Color coding (optional):** Muted tints indicate intent or qi type — red for aggression, blue for calm, yellow for neutral. Subtle, not magical.
- **Soft pulse or ripple:** The aura gently pulses, showing movement and life force rather than being static or neon.
- **Obstruction effect:** Walls, dense terrain, or obstacles partially blur or fragment the outline.
- **Directional flow hints:** High-level users see faint streaks showing likely movement or attack intent, like energy currents flowing along the target.
- **Environmental integration:** Subtle interactions with surroundings — dust stirred, leaves quiver, water ripples — to make perception feel physical.
- **Perception length/scale:** At low mastery, the user can detect qi **within ~1 meter**; mid-level, 2–5 meters; elite Strongest, up to **10 meters or more**, expanding not just distance but clarity and detail.

The effect remains **functional and tactical**, grounded in sensing qi, not breaking reality — visibility grows naturally with cultivation skill.


- **Core upper meridian ball:** The main focus remains the glowing sphere at the dantian/upper meridian.
- **Color meaning:**
    - **Red:** Brute-type — high durability, raw strength, hard to take down.
    - **Blue:** Assassin-type — fast, precise, highly perceptive, can detect subtle movement.
    - **Yellow:** Balanced-type — standard NPC, no extreme traits.
    - **Other muted tones** could represent specialized types (healer, tactician, etc.), but keep colors subtle to maintain realism.
- **Glow intensity:** Stronger NPCs emit a brighter, “hotter” aura, while weaker ones are dimmer.
- **Meridian veins:** Only visible at ultimate mastery, giving insight into attack style, weak points, and qi flow.
- **Gameplay effect:** The player sees both **power level (intensity)** and **combat type (color)** at a glance, which allows strategy without giving literal “x-ray” vision.
This lets **Qi Echo Traces** communicate tactical information — difficulty, style, and awareness — while staying grounded in the idea that the player is sensing **physical qi**, not magic.
