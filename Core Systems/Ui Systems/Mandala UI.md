**THE POSE:**
- Player sits in meditation
- Right hand up (yang), left hand down (yin)
- Circular hand movement creates yin-yang energy flow

**WHEN HANDS FORM YIN-YANG:**
- **Mandala/cultivation mandala appears** cant appear normally only in that pose and it zooms in when the player enters the pose making the mandala clearly visible
- Triggered by completing the yin-yang hand gesture
- Circle grows in size and complexity based on cultivation stage
- **Meditative sitting pose** with eyes closed

**FOR YOUR GAME:**
- Player sits in this exact pose during cultivation
- When they activate the cultivation check, the **misty mandala fills the entire circular space** between their hands
- The mandala would appear right in that perfect circle formed by the hand positioning
- Complexity of the mandala shows their cultivation stage
- Ethereal, translucent appearance fits the mystical mood
- The bigger stage the more power mandala emits and glows

**MANDALA = QI TECHNIQUE MASTERY INTERFACE** So in your Korean murim game: **Books/Scrolls** = physical fighting moves (sword stances, kicks, etc.) **Meridians** = raw qi power/capacity **MANDALA** = **qi manipulation techniques UI**

**What unlocks in the mandala as you progress:**
- **Thunder Qi** - (Fast and sharp bursts of qi can be controlled and directed at opponents)
- **Poison Qi** - (Immunity to most poisons and ability to use their own blood as a mild poison)
- **Chaos Qi** - (Corrupted Qi obtained by incorrect cultivation or uncontrolled emotion - TABOO: execution if discovered)
- **Qi Pressure** (intimidation/suppression and difficulty to breath)
- **Killing Intent** (fear/paralysis effects and uncontrolled emotion)
- **Sword Qi** (transferring players qi onto the weapon)
- **Body Strengthening** (defense/durability for the meridian veins not the body)
- **Qi Sensing** (detection abilities, and being able to measure opponents level)
- **Internal Healing** (recovery and purification's)
- **Qi Concealment** (stealth, disguises sound and perception)
- **Qi Burst** (explosive output of big amounts of qi)

**How it would work:**
- Each section of the mandala unlocks at different meridian mastery levels
- You use your **internal cultivation** to learn these **qi manipulation skills**
- No books needed - it's all about **understanding your own energy**
- The Korean geometric patterns show which **qi control techniques** you've mastered
