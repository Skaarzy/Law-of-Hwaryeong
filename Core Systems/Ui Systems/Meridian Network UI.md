**Meridian System (With UI):**

- **Visual Interface**: Meridians have a **dedicated UI** that shows the character's energy channels like a branching map or a diagram on the body.
- Starts with **main core veins**, and as the player levels up, more **branches and sub-veins unlock**.
- Each meridian branch can show: If it's unlocked -If it's blocked or damaged -What benefits it provides (Qi flow boost, resistance, elemental synergy, etc.)
- Breakthroughs trigger **new vein branches to appear**, visually and in the UI.
- The UI could be opened in meditation mode or via a menu when resting.

**Core System:**

- **Qi = Universal Resource** - used for combat techniques and meridian unlocking
- **Inner Core = Qi Capacity** - cultivation increases core size and max qi
- **Stage Breakthrough** - Requires completing certain techniques and abilities to maximum mastery, PLUS inner core reaching specific qi capacity threshold
- **Meridian Unlocking** - spending qi to open pressure points within your current stage

**Progression Flow:**

1. **Cultivate** to gather qi and strengthen inner core
2. **Master required techniques** - must fully upgrade certain abilities and techniques to maximum level
3. **Stage breakthrough** triggers when BOTH core capacity AND technique mastery requirements are met
4. **New meridian groups unlock** (Stage 3 = arms/legs, Stage 4 = heart/lung/core)
5. **Spend qi** to unlock individual pressure points within available meridians
6. **Anatomical prerequisites** - must unlock main branches before sub-branches
7. **Core brightness** shows overall meridian development progress
8. When both thresholds are met, **stage advancement** becomes available

**Player Agency:**

- **Choose which meridians to prioritize** within each stage
- **Balance qi spending** between combat readiness and meridian development
- **Specialization paths** - focus on combat, healing, spiritual abilities, etc.
- **Speed vs completeness** - unlock minimum for advancement or maximize current stage
- **Technique mastery requirement** - must choose which abilities to fully develop for breakthrough

**Combat Integration:**

- **Stage determines** qi capacity and what techniques you can handle
- **Meridians determine** which specific techniques can be learned in Mandala UI and qi efficiency
- Advanced techniques require both sufficient **core strength** and proper **meridian pathways**

**Visual UI:**

- Body map showing current stage's available meridians as connected pressure point dots
- Inner core that brightens as capacity increases toward next breakthrough threshold
- Clear prerequisite chains preventing impossible unlocks
- Technique mastery progress indicators for breakthrough requirements
