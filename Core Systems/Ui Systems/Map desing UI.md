## **Visual Style Foundation**
- **Base:** Aged parchment texture with beige/tan background
- **Color Palette:** Muted earth tones - very subtle, faded colors only
- **Line Art:** Simple black ink lines throughout
- **Overall Feel:** Worn, authentic historical manuscript

## **Geographic Elements**

**Mountains:**
- **Simple triangular patterns** repeated in rows
- **Light green wash** over basic line work
- Create a few triangle "stamps" and repeat them across mountain ranges

**Water Bodies:**
- **Rivers:** Thin blue lines (simple curved paths)
- **Seas/Lakes:** Extremely faded blue wash (almost transparent)
- **Coastlines:** Simple wavy line borders

**Boundaries & Paths:**
- **Provincial borders:** Dashed or dotted lines
- **Roads/paths:** Thin solid lines
- **All in black ink** with consistent line weights

## **Settlement System (3 Tiers)**

## **Color Coding System**
- **Same size icons** but different colors for faction control
- **Dynamic banners** that change based on regional power
- **Settlements change color** when control shifts

## **Interactive Features**
- **Hover details** for cities/villages (your existing UI panel)
- **Dynamic information** based on MC's path and discoveries
- **Political intelligence** varies by player's background

## **Implementation Strategy**
- **Create symbol templates** (mountain triangles, city squares, etc.)
- **Use pattern repetition** rather than unique drawing
- **Simple geometric shapes** for all elements
- **Consistent sizing system** throughout
- **Minimal but effective color washes**

**Key Principle:** Consistency over complexity - a few well-designed symbols repeated throughout will look more authentic than trying to draw everything uniquely.
## **Red Dot Marker System**
**Visual Design:**
- **Bright red dot** (contrasts well with muted historical colors)
- **Slightly larger** than village dots for visibility
- **Simple circle** - no fancy designs needed
- **Maybe a thin black outline** to make it pop against any background

**Functionality:**
- **Right-click to place** marker anywhere on map
- **Only one active marker** at a time (new placement removes old one)
- **Shows travel distance/time** to marked location
- **Persists during exploration** until manually moved or removed

## **Ri Measurement**
**1 ri = 0.1km (100 meters)**

## **Major Roads Only**
- **Ri stone markers** placed every **1 ri (100 meters)** along major government roads
- **No markers** on secondary roads or village paths
- **Visual:** Small stone pillar symbols with ri numbers along thick road lines

## **Map Scale (80km x 80km)**
- **Total map:** 800 ri x 800 ri
- **Major cities:** 150-400 ri apart (15-40km)
- **Cross-province journeys:** 200-500 ri (20-50km)
- **Full map crossing:** ~800 ri (80km)

## **Journey Examples**
- "Travel 50 ri to nearest town" = 5km journey
- "200 ri to Provincial Capital" = 20km major journey
- "500 ri to distant sect" = 50km epic expedition
- "800 ri across the Jeong Dynasty" = 80km legendary quest

## **Historical Accuracy**
- **Regional ri variation** - justified as local kingdom measurement
- **Major roads only** - matches Korean historical practice
- **Stone markers** - authentic Joseon dynasty navigation system

**Perfect balance:** Big impressive ri numbers + realistic Royal-scale distances + historically accurate Korean road marking system.
