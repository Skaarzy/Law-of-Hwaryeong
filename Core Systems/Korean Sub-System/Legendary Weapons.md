# Ink Painting Legendary Weapon System

## Overview

Ancient Korean weapon masters commissioned scroll paintings depicting their legendary armaments before hiding them away for future worthy warriors. These tall scroll paintings were torn into four fragments and scattered across the world to protect the weapons' locations. Each complete painting contains both the weapon's visual description and a geological riddle pointing to a specific landmark where the weapon rests.
