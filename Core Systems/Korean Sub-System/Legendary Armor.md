# Korean Stele Legendary Armor System

## Overview
Ancient Korean steles (석비) are found in Buddhist temples and mountain shrines throughout the world. These stone monuments honor legendary heroes, master warriors, and renowned generals from Korea's past. Each stele contains inscriptions about the honored figure's achievements and a mysterious riddle that promises great favor to those who can decipher it.

## Stele Inscription Format

### Header

**"Memorial to Hero Name, Title/Position"** _Example: "Memorial to Master Kang Cheol-su, Iron Fist General of the Northern Mountains"_

### Achievements Section

A brief account of the hero's most notable accomplishments:
- Major battles won
- Martial techniques mastered
- Lives saved or territories protected
- Legendary deeds performed

### The Mysterious Riddle
Each stele contains a cryptic riddle written in classical Korean poetry style. The inscription always ends with: _"Should one decipher this riddle's truth and speak it in sacred contemplation, the honored spirit shall grant their favor to them and bring fortune to them."_

## The "Non-Active" Mechanic

### Visual Indicators
Some steles are simply **decorative/historical monuments**:
- **Standard memorial inscriptions** with no mysterious riddle
- **Historical records only** - just achievements and dates
- **No spiritual energy** present around the stone

### Interaction Response
When examining these non-active steles: _"This memorial honors [Hero Name] and records their great deeds for posterity. The inscription serves as a historical testament to their legacy."_

**Player can:**
- Read the full historical account
- Learn lore about the hero
- Gain world knowledge/background information
- No meditation or trial available

### Lore Purpose
- **World-building depth** - Not every hero left a spiritual trial
- **Realism** - Some were solved by other people who are strong martial artists
- **Realistic variety** - Most real steles were just memorials
- **Historical immersion** - Some heroes are simply remembered, not challengeable
- **Content padding** - Provides lore and atmosphere without gameplay mechanics

## Example Stele: Master Thunder Fist

**Memorial to Master Hwang Roe-jin, Thunder Fist of the Storm Peaks**

_Here lies the record of Master Hwang, whose fists moved like lightning and whose courage shook mountains. In the year of the Iron Dragon, he defended the village of Birch Falls from a thousands of bandits, his strikes echoing like thunder through the valley. When darkness fell upon the land, he stood as the beacon that guided lost souls to safety._

**His Last Statement:** _"I strike without blade, I roar without voice,  
In stillness I'm born, yet in motion rejoice.  
The heavens release me, the earth feels my power,  
I flash for an instant, yet shake every tower.  
What am I, that dances between sky and ground,  
Where silence and fury in one moment are found?"_
