# Secret Technique Fragments System

## Overview
Ancient Korean martial arts masters carved fragments of their legendary techniques into manuals but after those masters died each ordered their disciple before their death to some rip those manuals apart into torn manual pages and scatter them around the wold for the safety of everybody. These fragments are , hidden in remote locations, broke and forgotten temples, and ancient training grounds. Each fragment contains a portion of a complete fighting technique that must be learned through precise movement sequences.

## Fragment Discovery

### Fragment Types

**Torn Manual Pages:**
- Scattered in ruined dojangs, abandoned temples, and old libraries
- Aged paper or silk with detailed technique illustrations
- Sometimes found in hidden compartments or sealed containers

### Visual Recognition
- **Wooden Box with golden seal in middle** indicates a technique fragment
- **Intricate carved/drawn movement sequences** showing martial arts forms
- **Classical Korean text** describing the technique's purpose and origin

## Learning Mechanics

### Individual Fragment Learning

1. **Examine the Fragment** - Player reads the technique description and movement
2. **Enter Learning Mode** - Camera shifts to demonstration angle
3. **Movement Sequence Mini-Game:**
    - Button prompts appear in sequence matching the carved movements
    - Player must input commands with precise timing
    - **Success:** Fragment glows and disappears, movement is "learned"
    - **Failure:** Can retry immediately, no penalties

### Fragment Storage

- **Info Tab → Martial Arts → [Technique Name]**
- Shows collected fragments as illustrated movement sequences
- Displays completion progress (e.g., "3/7 Fragments Collected")
- Each fragment shows its traditional Korean name and brief description

- **Atmosphere building** - Makes active fragments feel more special and rare
