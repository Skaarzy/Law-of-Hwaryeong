**The Jeong Dynasty's Real Motivation:**

- The Heavenly Root Sect had the most valuable medicinal herb gardens and alchemical knowledge in the region
- These aren't just any herbs - they're rare cultivation aids, poison antidotes, and medical supplies that the Jeong Dynasty wants to control
- With their 5 allied clans, the Jeong Dynasty sees an opportunity to expand their pharmaceutical/medical monopoly

**The Coercive Offer:** _"The unorthodox sects clearly can't police themselves - look what happened with demon cultists in your ranks. As punishment, surrender the Heavenly Root territory to Royal administration. Refuse, and we'll consider ALL unorthodox sects as potential demon sympathizers."_

## Why This Works Perfectly

**Royal Advantages:**

- Control of rare medicinal resources gives them economic leverage
- The herb gardens could supply their 5 allied clans with cultivation aids
- They can claim it's "punishment" for harboring demon cultists, giving legal justification
- Doesn't require military action - just political pressure

**The Unorthodox Sects' Calculation:**

- Losing the territory hurts, but it's better than being branded demon sympathizers
- They keep their other territories and avoid Royal persecution
- The Three Elders can frame it as "taking responsibility" for the Heavenly Root failure
- They survive while the Orthodox Alliance faces ongoing Royal hostility

**Strategic Implications:**

- The Jeong Dynasty gains valuable resources without military risk
- Creates resentment that could fuel future conflicts
- The unorthodox sects lose face but maintain their existence
- Sets precedent for Royal land seizures using "security" justifications

This feels much more realistic - the Jeong Dynasty using political leverage to grab valuable resources rather than acting from desperation!
