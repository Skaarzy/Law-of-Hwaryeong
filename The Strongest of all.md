In the land of Hwaryeong there are many  that are stron
### **1. Faction Types & Distribution**

- **Orthodox Sects (7 provinces)**
    - Large, disciplined, socially prestigious sects.
    - Aligned culturally with the Jeong Dynasty, but operate independently.
    - Maintain martial, spiritual, and philosophical standards.

- **Unorthodox Sects (4 provinces)**
    - Smaller, experimental, or independent sects.
    - Free to practice their own martial arts and philosophies.
    - Coexist peacefully with orthodox sects; tension exists only in ideology and reputation, not morality.

- **Clans (5 provinces)**
    - Semi-autonomous families with Royal favor for specific services (e.g., protecting trade routes, forests, vessels).
    - Operate independently but report annually to the Royal city.
    - Neutral intermediaries; can interact with both orthodox and unorthodox sects.

- **Jeong Dynasty (1 province)**
    - Central authority, mostly neutral in daily affairs.
    - Steps in only for emergencies or war.
    - Aligns culturally with orthodox sects but doesn’t micromanage them.

- **Trading Company (1 province)**
    - Focused on commerce and economic influence.
    - Neutral with respect to sect ideology.
    - Controls trade routes and resources, offering a practical layer of influence.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics**
- Daily life: Each faction operates independently; Jeong Dynasty largely neutral.
- Cooperation: Only when major threats arise (e.g., war) do factions come together.
- Tension: Mostly ideological, reputational, or competitive — not moral.
- Subterfuge: Some factions may spy, gather intel, or subtly maneuver, but these are exceptions.

---
### **3. Key Principles**
- Gray morality: No faction is inherently “good” or “evil.”
- Power and respect drive relations, not ideology or Royal enforcement.
- Factions coexist in a balance reminiscent of Joseon-era social and political structures.

## Hierarchy of People

- **3 Immortal Immortals** – Absolute peak of power.
    
- **4 Heavenly Sovereigns** – Rule vast domains, each nearly an emperor.
    
- **5 Saints** – Masters of martial or elemental arts, awe-inspiring and feared.

For the 3 immortals they are absolute power and are respected by everybody .The sovereigns are the ones who are grandmasters of sects and are very powerful and most don't try to reach the title of the Immortal, those that do go about it by becoming a fourth one and not to kill one of the existing three, the saints on the other hands are a different story they are usually sect masters and some even have a sovereign in their sect those that doesn't strive to become a saint . Those that do usually stay saints unless things change in the sect meaning the sect suffers greatly which rarely happens.The saints are more likely to change because they like to compete with each other and others masters want to take their place .Some are really powerful and have stayed as saints for a long time.
