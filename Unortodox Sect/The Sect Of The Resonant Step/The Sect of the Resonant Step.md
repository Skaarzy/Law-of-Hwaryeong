Sect master : [[Kang Ryeong (강령) - The Soundless Storm]]
 The **Sect of the Resonant Step** is a silent and mysterious unorthodox sect, neither famous nor feared, but known about with deep respect among wandering martial artists and hermits of the outer provinces. Unlike the great sects that cultivate power through grand techniques or heavenly arts, the Resonant Step trains in something far more subtle: **sound, rhythm, and vibration**.

Its members believe that true mastery comes not from overwhelming force, but from perfect understanding of movement through sound. Most of its disciples are humble fighters, with little to no spiritual background, and among them are many who are blind, deaf, or considered broken by conventional sect standards — people who have found purpose through the sect’s unique teachings. They are taught to **“see without eyes, hear without ears,”** using the echoes of steps, the pressure of air, and the tremors of motion to perceive the world in a way few can.

Their martial forms are not flashy. They flow like a **conversation between body and ground**, often leaving enemies confused, off-balance, or disarmed without realizing how.

The Sect of the Resonant Step holds **no temple**, no flags, and no loyalty to any government or greater school. They walk the **edges of rivers, caves, and towns**, unnoticed but ever listening, training those few who are patient enough to hear the world in ways others never will.

Instead of a central home, the sect exists through **the homes of its disciples**, who offer shelter to traveling elders and practitioners. Scattered across the provinces are **healing houses**, simple hospitals and resting halls run by members of the sect. These places do not advertise who owns them — they simply offer healing to all. The income from these humble places is pooled, making the sect **entirely self-sufficient** and free of any dependence on nobles, governments, or sect alliances.

The sect has **no leader**. Only whispers remain of the one who founded it — a **frail, barefoot elder**, blind and deaf, who many believe was never real or has long passed on. But among certain circles, it is said that this man still walks the land, silent and unnoticed, **his every step rippling like thunder**, his name carried only in the breath of those who once fought beside him:
 **Soundless Storm.**
