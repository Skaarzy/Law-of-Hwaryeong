A forest that gained its name because no sun ever enters it and most living things avoid it only things like snakes, bugs and some birds that live in the trees are there but even they are rare.Its also the main capital and land of the [[Ink-Root Forestest Assassins]] who guard the forest and see it as a sacred place which none should touch.Nobody knows really where the [[Shadow-Ink Assassins (그림자먹 암살단)]] main city/capital is but it is told that the capital is guarded/surrounded by a thick fog which is made out of poison.The capital name is [[Geun Ha-yeong (근하영) - Shadow Beneath the Root]]

**Microclimate Creation:**
- **Perpetual canopy cooling**: Extremely dense canopy blocks all sunlight, keeping forest floor permanently cool
- **Thermal layering**: Temperature differential between warm canopy (sunlit) and cold forest floor creates permanent inversion
- **Humidity trap**: Dense vegetation creates 100% humidity that never evaporates due to lack of sun/wind

**Air Circulation Prevention:**
- **Zero wind penetration**: Canopy so thick that no air circulation reaches forest floor
- **Stagnant air pockets**: Air becomes stratified in layers with no mixing
- **Pressure differential**: Dense vegetation creates slight pressure differences that trap air masses

**Continuous Moisture Sources:**
- **Underground springs/seepage**: Constant water source feeding evaporation
- **Root system moisture**: Massive tree root networks constantly releasing water vapor
- **Decomposition fog**: Thick layer of rotting organic matter producing constant vapor

**Atmospheric Density Effects:**
- **CO2 concentration**: Dense vegetation produces CO2 that's heavier than air, creating bottom layer
- **Oxygen depletion zones**: Less oxygen at ground level makes air denser
- **Particle suspension**: Constant organic particles in air create "thicker" atmosphere

**The Science:** If trees are thick enough to create a completely isolated microclimate with no air circulation, permanent temperature inversion, and constant moisture sources, you could theoretically have year-round ground fog.

**Realistic but extreme** - like an enclosed atmospheric pocket within the forest
