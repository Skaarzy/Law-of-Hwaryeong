 **Sect Master: - **Gang Son-chan** (강손찬) - The Iron Fist General**
### **The Birth of the Iron Fist Unorthodox Sect**

Once a promising yet simple commoner, **Son Chan** (손찬) heard the tale of the Wandering Blade at the age of seventeen. Captivated by the legend, he became one of his many followers, setting out to find the elusive master. It took him seven long years to finally track down the Wandering Blade. During those years of searching, Gang Son-chan trained relentlessly, studying various martial styles and developing his own unique halberd techniques—crafted specifically with the intention of challenging the legend he admired.
When the long-awaited duel finally came, Gang Son-chan landed a strike on the master’s neck. Whether it was a fortunate blow or one the Wandering Blade allowed, no one would ever know. Regardless, the Wandering Blade acknowledged him and, in recognition, passed down a hidden martial art—one that merged bloodlust with killing intent. When combined properly, these forces neutralized one another, creating a profound calm in the body. This calm allowed the user to harness bloodlust as a form of qi.
However, as Gang Son-chan studied this technique further, he grew increasingly disturbed by the mounting instability in his master. Overuse of the method—especially without control—took a toll on the mind. During the brutal conflict of the Demon War, both Gang and the Wandering Blade led followers in an organized resistance. Amid the carnage, the Wandering Blade overused the bloodlust technique on a battlefield already drenched in death, pushing himself past the edge. For the first time, he lost all restraint, slaughtering both allies and enemies. After the war, he withdrew into bloodthirsty isolation.
Witnessing this collapse, Gang Son-chan made a solemn vow. He would not follow his master’s doomed path. Drawing on everything he had learned—both from his own training and the techniques he had acquired—he reformed the bloodlust method. In his new approach, all bloodlust was channeled into the weapon, while killing intent was focused into qi. This separation kept the mind clear, making the style far safer and more sustainable.
After the Demon War, Gang Son-chan saw how the Wandering Blade’s philosophy of “abandoning the past” had turned into senseless isolation and carnage. Though he still respected the master’s strength, he rejected his path of endless wandering and killing. From that conviction, Gang Son-chan founded the **Iron Fist Unorthodox Sect**—a new path forged from his will, discipline, and reformed power.

**"Forge your new self through strength, but build something lasting with it."**

Unlike his master who rejected all bonds and structure, Gang Son-chan believed that those who abandoned their past should create a **new family** and **permanent home** together. The sect welcomes outcasts, deserters, and the disillusioned, but instead of endless wandering, they build a **stable community** where strength serves protection rather than conquest.

# Twin Half Moon Jangchang
## Origin & Creation
The **Twin Half Moon Jangchang** is a unique weapon created by Gang Son-chan himself after he developed his reformed version of his master's bloodlust technique. Originally starting with a traditional jangchang, Gang Son-chan discovered a critical flaw when channeling his new martial arts through the weapon.

## Technical Innovation
The weapon began as a standard jangchang, but Gang Son-chan found that the energy flow of bloodlust moved too quickly through the straight-line spear design, making it difficult to control and balance with his killing intent qi. To solve this problem, he personally forged and added **two half-moon blades** on each side of the spear tip.
These curved blades serve a practical purpose: they force the bloodlust energy to split into 3 paths making the energy travel in a slower, more controlled paths around the weapon's head, creating better balance and allowing for more precise energy distribution between bloodlust and killing intent.

## Symbolic Meaning
The choice of **twin half-moons** carries deep personal significance for Gang Son-chan:

- **One half-moon** represents his master's destructive path - the Wandering Blade's descent into madness and isolation
- **The other half-moon** represents his own constructive path - building community and lasting strength

The dual blades serve as a constant reminder of the difference between his master's philosophy and his own, ensuring he never forgets what happened to his master and never strays from his chosen path of creating rather than destroying.
When wielded, the Twin Half Moon Jangchang channels bloodlust through the curved blades while focusing killing intent through the central spear point, creating the perfect balance that makes Gang Son-chan's reformed technique both powerful and sustainable - unlike his master's uncontrollable and self-destructive method.
