Built in a **mountainous region** with natural defenses, the sect's headquarters resembles a **fortified village** more than a traditional martial sect. At its heart stands a massive **communal forge**, where members craft their own weapons and tools—reflecting the sect’s philosophy of **creating rather than merely taking**.
The sect was founded in the aftermath of the Demon War by the former disciple of the Wandering Blade, who had since distanced himself from his master. While the sect’s techniques bear resemblance to those of the Wandering Blade, they are refined into a **safer and more controlled form of bloodlust**, allowing practitioners to wield its power without succumbing to madness.
After years of barely surviving in half broken villages, the sect was eventually convinced by **Dong Tak** to join the rebellion against the **Jeong Jeong Dynasty**. Dong Tak promised Gong and his followers a place within the **main Royal city**, and offered Gong a seat on the **Royal council**—a chance to reshape the Jeong Dynasty from within.

## **Relationship with The Wandering Blade**
The sect maintains **complicated feelings** toward their founder's original master:
- **Respect** for his strength and the techniques he taught
- **Sadness** at his descent into madness and isolation
- **Determination** to prove his philosophy could lead to something better
- **Fear** that they might face his wrath if he ever emerges from his mansion
They still practice modified versions of his techniques but have **purged the bloodthirsty elements**, focusing on **protection and building** rather than **conquest and collection**.

## **Sect Goals & Activities**
- Provide **sanctuary** for those rejected by orthodox sects
- **Train outcasts** to become productive members of society

The Iron Fist Unorthodox Sect represents what The Wandering Blade's philosophy could have become - **strength through unity** rather than strength through isolation.
