Second of the Six Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol is a mountain of muscle and fury, a being whose very presence scorches the earth beneath his feet. Towering above others, his body is wrapped in dark blue almost purple skin and when he uses his qi it turns dark red crimson color from all the heat and it starts glowing faintly. Not merely skin-deep, his flesh is fused with infernal essence, making him immune to fire and capable of absorbing heat and flames to fuel his power. Unlike Reung-ji , who wins wars with his mind, Hwa-ryeol crushes his enemies with overwhelming force. He is the Demon commanders walking catastrophe, a being of pure destruction and rage, forged for war and conquest. When the Heavenly Demon desires devastation without subtlety, it is Hwa-ryeol who is unleashed. His weapon is a gigantic, two-handed demon axe, forged in the magma pits of a fallen volcano. It is so heavy that it shatters the ground with each swing. The axe is rumored to contain the souls of hundreds of warriors, whose Qi he devoured in a legendary battle that turned an entire sect into a burning crater. When swung capable of cleaving through mountains and setting forests ablaze with a single strike. Despite his size and power, Hwa-ryeol is no mindless beast. He is loyal not because he was forced, but because he worships Tak-gu. He calls the Heavenly Demon “the Flame That Cannot Die,” and sees himself as the fuel of that flame, a tool meant to destroy the old world so the new one may rise.His red, starts breaking of like cracked skin constantly leaks embers and sparks, and when gets enraged, his entire body becomes engulfed in living flame. Warriors who try to strike him find their weapons melt, and their techniques burn away before reaching him. The heat around him alone can turn unprotected flesh to ash. Unlike the cunning or subtle Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol believes in one thing:
Power is truth. If you burn it to the ground, no one can lie about it anymore.

1. **Skin transition:** As he channels his fire technique, his purple-ish skin **heats and reddens**, glowing faintly from the heat beneath.
2. **Cracking effect:** The outer layer of skin **starts to char like burnt wood**, forming small cracks and flaking off slowly. Between the cracks, tiny **embers glow**, showing the raw heat and power under his skin.
3. **Falling flakes:** As the technique reaches full intensity, these charred flakes **fall away**, revealing his true **dark red, infernal skin** beneath—muscle and power fully exposed.
4. **Aftermath:** The visual effect is like a **living, walking forge**: the heat and fire literally “burn away” the outer layer of his mortal-like skin, emphasizing both his destructive power and demonic nature.
