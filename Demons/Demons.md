Heavenly Demon :
[[Tak-jin (탁진)(The Heavenly Demon)]]


Lower type demons:
**1. Gwishin — the Blood-Stained Dead**  
Born when Tak-jin drinks the blood of a cultivator. Some of his corrupted Qi leaks into the corpse, reanimating it. The Gwishin becomes a grotesque fusion of dead flesh and demonic energy — neither ghost nor man, but a furious echo of what it once was. It retains fragments of its former skills and memories, but all twisted by agony. The stronger the cultivator was, the more dangerous the Gwishin becomes. They wander battlefields and ruins, driven only by hunger and wrath.

**2. Yaksha — the Qi-Born Corruption**  
When Tak-jin creates his Asura Demons, small fragments of that living Qi sometimes break off — pieces of his will, like venomous parasites. These drift across the world and attach themselves to humans, especially broken warriors or those obsessed with power. The fragment seeps into the host’s meridians and mind, whispering promises until the host mutates into a Yaksha — a demonic hybrid, aware yet enslaved to destruction. Many never realize what’s happening until their body is no longer their own.

**3. Ma — the Cursed Sorcerers**  
These are living humans, cultists and evil cultivators who wield forbidden spells and talismans learned from Tak-jin’s scriptures. Their art is pure mental corruption — rituals that fracture the mind instead of the flesh. Victims fall into psychic torment, seeing illusions drawn from their fears, regrets, and guilt. These hallucinations can wound body and soul alike, breaking will before life. Ma take pleasure in this control, using madness as both weapon and art.

**4. Gumiho — the Blood Foxes**  
Created through vile rituals by Tak-jin’s worshipers. A chosen woman is sacrificed and transformed by binding her soul to a fox spirit using corrupted Qi. What emerges is a predator in perfect human form — immortal, cunning, and insatiable. Gumiho drain Qi instead of hearts, feeding on cultivators’ life force to restore and strengthen themselves mid-battle. They are infiltrators and assassins, bringing chaos wherever the cult’s influence spreads.
