The Third Demon Commander, Heuk-wol is a creature of silence and fear a phantom cloaked in shadow and smoke, moving in the shadows like a whisper of death. While others roar, blaze, or command armies, Heuk-wol says nothing. His presence is like a cold draft in the dead of night unnatural, unnoticed… until it is too late. He never speaks unless directly addressed by Tak-gu, and even then, his replies are brief, emotionless, and quiet. He does not need to assert his power his mere existence is a constant reminder that death can come without warning, without form, and without mercy. His body can become a shadow by infusing his qi into it making him be able to merge with any shadow in his area and he can move across rivers in a single step, its like a flowing mist that seems to drink in light itself. Cultivators say that even in sunlight, his silhouette flickers like smoke, and in battle, he often vanishes entirely. What he leaves behind are corpses cleanly slain, without sound or struggle. His movements are untraceable, and he walks without footprints or scent sometimes even becoming a show of his target and following them for days until the right moment, making him nearly impossible to track.Only Tak-gu has saw his face. Despite appearing as a mere servant or shadow at the side of other commanders, Heuk-wol is arguably the most dangerous of them all, and the only one who regularly stands near Tak-gu without speaking. Many believe he serves as the Heavenly Demon’s personal executioner, a blade hidden behind the throne. He wields a simple blade in hand but his main weapon is his shadow itself transforming and becoming his weapon, stretching, slicing, piercing, and corrupting. He can melt into the ground, rise behind opponents,. It is said his Qi is not alive, but a smoke that is darker than the night, impossible to sense until it is too late. Even among demon commander, no one trusts Heuk-wol not because he is disloyal, but because he is too quiet, too still, never sleeps and is faceless.

replace actual hands with shadow hands and keep the string but also make them shadow remove one of the sword and make his techniques look like moving shadow that doesn't have the normal shape of a sword but constantly changes its shape and only when it moves can u see the blade like smoke the shadow is delayed if not using technique then just simple sword as he is skilled in sword art, his helmet replace it with the hat like in the above image,keep his lower clothes as in image bellow but add when he isn't fighting a robe on top like in picture above
