As the conspirators gathered to plan the overthrow of Emperor Gwangheon, they discussed the question of succession. For legitimacy, they agreed that the crown prince — the emperor's son through the daughter of the Military Minister's brother — should be placed on the throne once Gwangheon was removed. This arrangement gave the conspirators a plausible pretext: the heir was of royal blood, yet connected to the minister who would ostensibly guide him. The young prince had grown up admiring the Military Minister as a protector and mentor, seeing him as a strong and unshakable figure.
But before the coup could begin, Dong Tak acted. In a sudden, calculated strike, he killed the Military Minister, leaving no trace and ensuring that no one could challenge him or interfere with his ambitions. The minister's death was a devastating blow — not only politically, but personally for the crown prince, who had viewed the minister as a role model and protector.
When the Military Minister vanished, the other conspirators approached the crown prince with urgent reassurances. They claimed his mentor had abandoned him at the critical moment, fleeing to save himself. But they insisted the prince should continue with the coup under their guidance — after all, the plan remained sound, and they would protect him where the minister had failed.
The prince, already suspicious of these men his mentor had never fully trusted, felt his instincts screaming danger. Something about their story didn't align with the man he knew. Seeking answers, he quietly investigated his mentor's private office, searching for any clue about what had truly happened.
There, he found items his mentor never left behind — a family seal the minister wore always, a ceremonial sword he'd carried since his military days, personal letters showing plans to protect the prince during the coup. These were not the belongings of a man who fled. His mentor hadn't abandoned him. Someone had killed him.
The realization struck like ice: if the other ministers were lying about the abandonment, they likely knew what really happened — or had orchestrated it themselves. The coup wasn't about placing him on the throne; it was about controlling him as their puppet. And if they'd eliminated his protector to seize control, the prince himself was next.
Terror and grief overwhelmed him. The one person he'd trusted was dead, murdered by the very men now claiming to guide him. The court he'd grown up in was a nest of vipers, and he had no power to fight them.
Knowing he could rely on no one, the 16-year-old crown prince quietly prepared to flee. He gathered essential belongings, used hidden paths through the capital, and contacted the few loyal allies he could trust to help him escape. He didn't tell anybody about his plan other than the people who helped him — not even his father knew, as the Minister of Military Kim Jae-hwan had always talked about Emperor Gwangheon being an untrustworthy person who let foreigners into the empire and that Emperor Gwangheon ruined the whole empire by doing this.
So under the cover of night, the crown prince slipped away, beginning his journey as the lost heir who would later find refuge with the sect alliance. His escape was driven by terror, grief, and the painful understanding that the world he had known — his mentor, the court, and the presumed safeguards of his position — had vanished.
What the prince didn't know was that his suspicions, while reasonable, were incomplete. The ministers hadn't killed his mentor — Dong Tak had, eliminating the one man who might have controlled the conspiracy. The ministers themselves would soon become Dong Tak's victims, trapped by blackmail and manipulation. The prince's instincts had saved him, but by luck as much as wisdom. He'd fled from the wrong enemy at exactly the right moment, escaping just before Dong Tak's true betrayal unfolded.
Years later, after reclaiming his throne with the sect alliance's help, the now-Emperor finally captured Dong Tak. During their confrontation, Dong Tak revealed the truth with cruel satisfaction: he had killed Kim Jae-hwan, the prince's beloved mentor. But there was more — the entire coup had been Kim's idea from the beginning. The Minister hadn't been protecting the prince out of love or loyalty. He had orchestrated everything: poisoning the prince's mind against his father, grooming him for the throne, planning the coup. And the prince had been chosen not because Kim cared for him, but because he was the easiest to control — young, malleable, desperate for a father figure.
The Emperor dismissed it as the desperate lies of a condemned tyrant and executed Dong Tak, believing justice was finally served.
But the claim gnawed at him. Over the following years, small inconsistencies emerged. Documents surfaced. Testimonies aligned. The Emperor began investigating in secret, unable to let the doubt rest.
Eventually, the terrible truth crystallized: Dong Tak had been telling the truth. Kim Jae-hwan had orchestrated the coup, had manipulated him from childhood, had chosen him not out of love but out of calculation. Every warm moment, every lesson, every word of encouragement — all of it had been a lie designed to create the perfect puppet emperor.
The realization shattered everything. The man he'd loved as a father had been his enemy. The mentor he'd mourned had been manipulating him all along. He hadn't been special or beloved — he'd been easy to control. If Kim had fooled him so completely, how could he trust his own judgment about anything? About anyone?
In his final years, the Emperor who had saved the realm descended into paranoia. He questioned every advisor, suspected every ally, saw manipulation in every gesture of friendship. The hero who had restored the dynasty became a broken, suspicious ruler, unable to trust even his own perceptions.
Dong Tak's final cruelty had succeeded from beyond the grave. The Emperor had won his throne, but lost himself in the process.
