Born : 1447
Ruled : 1463–1468(Age 47 to 52 )
Died: unknown maybe shown maybe a dlc 

**Early Life (1416-1432):** Dong Tak was born into poverty in the Jeong Dynasty's capital province. His parents died when he was 16, leaving him orphaned with no prospects. To survive, he joined the Imperial Army—one of the few paths available to commoners with nothing to lose.
**Military Career (1432-1450s):** Through fifteen years of exceptional skill and unwavering loyalty, Dong Tak distinguished himself in the ranks. His competence caught the attention of high-ranking military official **Kim Jae-hwan (김재환)**, a powerful former general with ambitions that extended beyond the battlefield. Kim recognized something useful in Dong Tak: intelligence, ruthlessness, and the hunger of a man who'd clawed up from nothing.
**Rise Through Patronage (1450s-1461):** Kim Jae-hwan took Dong Tak under his protection, teaching him literacy, Confucian classics, and court etiquette—the tools nobles used to maintain their power. With Kim's patronage, Dong Tak was appointed to a minor government post. Over the next decade, he proved his competence and loyalty repeatedly, rising through the ranks until he reached a mid-level court position by his mid-40s.
But despite his achievements, the noble-born officials never truly accepted him. He was always "Kim's commoner pet," tolerated but never respected. No matter how high he climbed, there was always a ceiling—the invisible barrier that separated those born to power from those who merely served it.
**The Conspiracy (1461-1462):** In 1461, when Dong Tak was 45, Kim Jae-hwan revealed his true intentions. That Kim Jae-hwan and a group of high-ranking conservative officials, furious at Emperor Gwangheon's foreign reforms and modernization policies, had been forming a plan for years and finally will make it happen it was a conspiracy to overthrow him. They would install Kim Jae-hwan as the new Emperor—a return to traditional Jeong Dynasty values, an end to the embarrassment of the use of guns and getting help from the foreign advisors.
Kim offered Dong Tak a high-ranking position in the new government in exchange for a crucial task: recruit commoners throughout the capital and provinces to spread carefully crafted rumors about Emperor Gwangheon's "corruption and incompetence." These recruited agitators would create the public justification needed for the coup. The officials needed popular support—or at least popular indifference—to legitimize their overthrow of the throne.
Dong Tak agreed immediately. But as he spent months recruiting, organizing, and building networks among the desperate and discontented, a realization crystallized: he was building an army of followers loyal to him, not Kim. He had the organizational structure. He had the masses ready to move. 
**The Betrayal (1462):** During a private meeting in the commoner district of the Imperial City, Dong Tak requested Kim Jae-hwan's presence to discuss final plans for the uprising. The location was Dong Tak's suggestion—fewer court spies in the slums, he reasoned, and Kim trusted his protégé enough to agree. They sat reviewing which officials supported the coup, which Imperial Guard units were compromised, when to strike.
Kim Jae-hwan leaned forward to examine a map spread across the table, exposing his neck. In that moment, Dong Tak saw his entire future clearly: if the coup succeeded, he would be Kim's servant forever—elevated, yes, but still a commoner playing at nobility. If it failed, he'd be executed as a conspirator. But if Kim simply... disappeared? Then the papers, the network, the momentum—all of it would belong to Dong Tak alone.
Why accept a high-ranking position when he could be Emperor?
The dagger was in Kim's neck before the general could turn his head. Dong Tak's recruited "commoners"— Dong Tak disposed of the body in the slums where hundreds died unremarked every month. Kim Jae-hwan, the powerful general, became just another corpse in an unmarked grave.
**The Masterstroke (1462):** Dong Tak immediately spread a carefully constructed story: Kim Jae-hwan had fled the capital in the night after Dong Tak discovered his conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor. As proof, Dong Tak produced the sealed letters and documents.
But Dong Tak went further. He edited the papers with surgical precision, making the conspiracy appear even more extensive. Then he spread a more devastating claim: the entire Imperial Court was corrupt, rotten to the core. The officials weren't trying to save the Jeong Dynasty; they were trying to control it for their own greed as he named some of the officials that weren't even corrupt just so he can get rid of them and negate their power of word .
The people, already prepared by months of Dong Tak's rumors about Imperial incompetence and corruption, believed every word. Here was a commoner-born official, one of their own, exposing the rot at the heart of power. The previous rumors hadn't been lies—they'd been warnings. Kim's "flight" only confirmed what Dong Tak had been saying all along.
**The Trap Springs (1462):** The conspirators found themselves in an impossible position. They knew Dong Tak had murdered Kim—it was obvious to anyone who understood court politics. But what could they prove? Kim's body was gone. Dong Tak possessed letters bearing their seals, proving their treason.
**The Conspirators' Surrender (Late 1462-1463):**
The trapped conspirators watched Dong Tak's rebellion grow unstoppable. They resorted to assassination attempts. Dong Tak survived them all—protected by the **Iron Fist Sect (철권파)**, the unorthodox martial artists Kim Jae-hwan had originally hired as muscle for the coup. Kim had promised them large amount of money and a empty lot in the Jeong Dynasty province. When Kim died, Dong Tak made a way better proposal he offered legitimacy along with official positions as Imperial Guards, homes in the Imperial City, regular pay, and recognition. The Iron Fist Sect, pragmatic and transactional, had no loyalty to a dead patron. They needed a way to survive and not die off so they protected their new benefactor with brutal efficiency.
Every failed assassination attempt only made Dong Tak look more heroic—a commoner fighting for truth against a corrupt elite trying to silence him. The people saw a martyr surviving murder attempts by the "corrupt nobility." Each failure made him stronger.. Public opinion turned completely against the Imperial Court. Emperor Gwangheon's every move backfired. By late 1462, the writing was on the wall: Dong Tak was going to win.
Faced with a choice between dying with Gwangheon or surviving with Dong Tak, the conspirators made the pragmatic choice. They approached Dong Tak secretly, offering to switch sides. They would publicly support the rebellion, use their positions to undermine Gwangheon from within, and help Dong Tak take the throne. In exchange, they wanted to survive—and preferably profit.
Dong Tak accepted with a cold smile. The blackmail papers had served their purpose; he no longer needed them as leverage. What he needed now was legitimacy. Having Imperial officials publicly support his cause would prove he wasn't just a rebel—he was a savior backed by "righteous" members of the court itself.
**The Forbidden City Assault (1463):**
When Dong Tak's forces stormed the Forbidden City, the conspirators were his inside agents. They helped him navigate the palace, identified which guards could be bribed or threatened, and opened gates at crucial moments. They stood beside him when he killed Emperor Gwangheon, giving the murder a veneer of official sanction.
Dong Tak's propaganda machine immediately went to work: these officials were "heroes" who had discovered the corruption alongside him. When they realized how deep the rot went—how Gwangheon himself was complicit—they'd courageously joined the people's champion to save the Jeong Dynasty. They were proof that not all nobles were corrupt, that good men existed even in the rotten court.
**Emperor Gwangheon's Futile Response (1462-1463):** Emperor Gwangheon was furious and desperate, but everything he tried backfired catastrophically. He was trapped in a narrative he couldn't escape:
- **When he tried to arrest Dong Tak:** The people rioted, seeing it as persecution of their champion. "The corrupt Emperor silences those who speak truth!"
- **When he tried to ignore it:** The rebellion grew stronger, spreading to more provinces.
- **When he tried to expose the real conspiracy:** No one believed him. "Of course the guilty Emperor blames others!"
- **When he offered to negotiate:** It looked like admission of guilt. "He's trying to buy silence because the accusations are true!"
- **When he sent soldiers to suppress protests:** It confirmed every claim. "See how the tyrant treats his own people!"
Gwangheon had spent years making himself unpopular with his foreign reforms, gun integration, and disregard for tradition. The conservative nobles who might have supported him were either part of the conspiracy or unwilling to risk themselves. The common people already distrusted him. And Dong Tak controlled the narrative through his recruited masses—thousands of agitators in every major city, all spreading the same coordinated message.
It was already too late. The fire was burning, and every attempt to extinguish it only fed the flames.
**The Rebellion (1462-1463):** What had begun as Kim Jae-hwan's conspiracy became Dong Tak's revolution. Protests turned to riots, riots to armed rebellion. With the Iron Fist Sect as his military arm and his recruited commoners as his political base, Dong Tak rallied the discontented across the Jeong Dynasty. He promised an end to corruption, a government that served the people instead of parasitic nobles, and justice for decades of abuse.
In 1463, Dong Tak's forces stormed the Forbidden City. He personally killed Emperor Gwangheon, then spread the lie that the Emperor had tried to flee "like a coward" when the people came for justice. Few believed the literal details, but it didn't matter—the narrative was already set. The Jeong Dynasty needed change, and Dong Tak had delivered it.
**The Tyrant Emperor (1463-1468):** Dong Tak crowned himself Emperor at age 47, becoming the first commoner to sit on the throne in the Jeong Dynasty's history. The people celebrated. Finally, one of their own ruled.
But power revealed Dong Tak's true nature. The reformer became a paranoid tyrant, the people's champion became their oppressor. He hunted for surviving members of the Royal bloodline with obsessive fury, executed anyone who questioned his authority, and ruled through fear and propaganda. The officials who'd been trapped by his blackmail were systematically purged and other more corrupt ones took their place. The Iron Fist Sect became his personal enforcers, brutally suppressing dissent.
The commoners who'd believed in him watched in horror as their hero transformed into something worse than what they'd overthrown. Dong Tak had promised to end corruption—instead, he perfected it.
**The Vanishing (1468):** When the Sect Alliance and the surviving Royal heir finally defeated his forces and stormed the Forbidden City, Dong Tak vanished without a trace. Some say he fled to foreign lands, others that he changed his identity and disappeared into the masses he'd once claimed to represent. His fate remains unknown—perhaps deliberately, perhaps as one final manipulation, leaving the question of his survival to haunt those who opposed him.
**Legacy:** Dong Tak proved that anyone could reach the throne—but he also proved that birth meant nothing compared to character. A commoner Emperor could be just as corrupt, just as tyrannical, just as destructive as any noble-born ruler. His reign became a cautionary tale: revolutions built on lies and manipulation, no matter how justified they seem, inevitably devour those who believe in them.
