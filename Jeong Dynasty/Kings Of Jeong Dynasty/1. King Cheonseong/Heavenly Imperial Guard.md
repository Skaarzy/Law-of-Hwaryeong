King Cheonseong, a greedy and controlling ruler, always yearned for absolute safety and unquestioned obedience. Desiring guards who would never falter or betray him, he created a force that transcended life and death: the **Royal Heavenly Guard**.
These were no ordinary statues. Each one was carved from rough, unyielding stone by simple craftsmen who believed they were making memorials to fallen soldiers. They shaped them to resemble the dead with near life-like detail, their surfaces left rugged and cracked, as if already battle-worn.
At the heart of every statue lies a **jade ring**, set where the upper inner core would be. This ring acts as a **conduit**, containing and stabilizing the soul of a warrior who had volunteered to protect the king even in death. Its circular form, with its hollow center, serves as a chamber that keeps the soul confined; without it, the statue is nothing more than inert stone.
Once the statues were completed, the jade rings were embedded into their chests by the martial arts masters of the **Divine Seal Sect**. The jade was heated to an extreme temperature, hot enough to partially melt the surrounding stone, binding itself into the body. The masters worked swiftly, dousing the seams with water to prevent the molten stone from leaking and damaging the statues.
Every ring was inscribed with the **same bujeok spell** — not on paper, but carved directly into the jade — a spell of obedience to the master. The emperor himself bore a matching jade ring, embedded in his own chest and inscribed with a master-level seal. When he activated his qi, his ring resonated with those in the statues, awakening them, and they obeyed his thoughts as though they were their own.
The statues are animated by the **bound qi of the soldiers’ souls**, flowing through veins of **Hwangto** packed into the cracks and crevices of the stone. **Hwangto / Yellow Earth Stone** is also set where the eyes would be, acting as a window to the soldiers’ souls, allowing them to “see” through them. Normally, the statues operate using only their own life force. But in moments of desperation, the emperor could extend his qi into them, amplifying their strength — though at great cost. The more statues he commanded, and the longer he held them, the more his own inner core was drained. If the veins ran empty, his life force itself began to unravel, leading to certain death.
These soldiers are timeless. Their stone bodies never decay, though their Hwangto veins may need replenishing if damaged in battle — a rare occurrence. They obey only the emperor, incapable of corruption, bribery, or betrayal. Each statue carries the soul of a warrior who once swore eternal loyalty, waiting in silence until called, ready to rise again in a new vessel if shattered.
The Royal Heavenly Guard are not merely statues. They are the **eternal devotion of fallen warriors**, forged in stone and jade, animated by their own qi, and bound solely to the emperor’s will — an unbreakable army, whose terrible power is tethered to the life of the king himself.

- If the armor is **carved in high relief** with sharp edges, etched patterns, or layered plates, it can look **dynamic and striking** even in stone.
- Adding **texture contrasts** — polished “metallic” areas vs rough stone — can prevent it from looking flat or dull.
- You can also use **color accents, metallic paint, or glowing effects** on edges or crests to give it life without breaking the carved look.
