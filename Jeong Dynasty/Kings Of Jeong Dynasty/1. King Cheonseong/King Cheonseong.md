**King Cheonseong (천성 / 天聖) – “Heavenly Saint”**

The King Cheonseong was a younger ruler who gained the throne after his father [[King Ryonghwang]] died of a sudden heart attack,he became emperor when he was 27 (1348 year)
Made the army of 5000 jade soldiers named [[Heavenly Imperial Guard]] which he controlled with his mind it was a secret technique that was created by the Divine Seal sect specifically for him, he had 4 children 3 daughters and 1 sons , the ages where : 
- **1st daughter (1350):** Jeong Woo-jin was **26 years old**
- **2nd daughter (1352):** Jeong Woo-jin was **28 years old**
- **3rd daughter (1354):** Jeong Woo-jin was **30 years old**
- **Son (1357):** Jeong Woo-jin was **33 years old**
Like his father he didn't care about love or companionship but only about producing a heir who would continue his legacy, he didn't care much about his daughters but still would grant them anything they wanted, as he considered they deserve anything they want because of their lineage and him being their father, his son on the other hand he held on a pedestal teaching him from young age of 7 and always being stern towards him and punishing him if the son would fail or make a mistake. Jeong Woo-jin was often called reckless and too chaotic of a king, as he believed that his father Jeong Ryong didn't die by natural causes but that someone killed him, which is why he create the soldiers and never trusted most of the royal court officials, yet with all that the kingdom still was flourishing for a long time as he still made decision that benefited the people of the kingdom even built the second mayor city in the province then the Eternal war started.Jeong Woo-jin died defending the capital city of the kingdom against demons in a last struggle battle which helped win the war against the demons.
