As his father sacrifices himself to protect the city his son Myeong-ho becomes the new emperor in as the eternal war was ending without choice in the matter, living not in the palace which was now rumble but with the beggars and thief's, eating sleeping and fighting with them the remaining of the demonic forces which thought him how to survive without a guard or a army, and he did no matter the cost .He immediately after the demon war before anyone started to rebuild gave the order to instead of rebuilding things as they were, take massive area of the city central and transform it into a fortress for the emperor which would withstand any attack in the future and keep the emperor safe no matter the situation in which the emperor and his servants and guards will live making it the most secure place on earth. He was considered a tyrant as he demolished even more just so he can be protected not caring about his people and that they are living on the street and their houses and whole districts where nothing but dust.He had only 1 child that was a boy who he had before he became emperor. but as fate would have he didn't get to see it finished as he died from a sudden Aneurysm, his last decree ever was to name the fortress the Eternal Imperial Palace 영원한 황궁 (Yeongwonhan Hwang-gung), hated even after his death made the Jeong Dynasty lineage look worst and worst as 3 generations of kings failed its kingdom
