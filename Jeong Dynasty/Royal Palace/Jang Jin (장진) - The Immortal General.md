_금위대장_ (Geumwi Daejang) Commander of the Royal Guards (1264 - 1514)
Died: 1514 (struggle against the corrupt officials)

**Role:** Royal Commandant, Guardian of the Emperor  
**Appearance:** Jang Jeong’s imposing figure is balanced by an easygoing charm. With a rugged, unkempt look—his hair often a little messy and his armor practical but unpolished—he has the air of someone who doesn’t put too much stock in formalities. Despite his casual, almost carefree appearance, his presence demands attention, especially when he wields his massive dadao, a thick, wide blade that fits his larger-than-life personality.

**Personality:** Jang Jin is an extroverted, larger-than-life personality with a constant energy that can lift any room. Though his role as the Royal Commandant is one of responsibility and discipline, he doesn’t let it weigh him down. Instead, he’s known for his infectious laughter, quick wit, and a love for joking around, even in the most serious situations. He’s the kind of person who’s always ready to crack a joke or lighten the mood, and his presence brings a sense of ease to those around him. His personality is warm, brimming with confidence and a carefree attitude that puts others at ease, though it sometimes leads to his being seen as unrefined or a bit too informal for his position.

Jang Jin doesn’t concern himself with stiff protocols and formalities. He’s not one to stand on ceremony, often showing up to important events with little regard for tidiness or perfect manners—he’s the kind of person who’ll chuckle at his own mess. Despite his lack of concern for appearances, his loyalty and sense of duty to the emperor are ironclad. He’ll fight tooth and nail to protect the throne and those he cares about, and his larger-than-life personality masks an unshakable resolve.

**Abilities and Martial Arts:** Jang Jin is a true powerhouse, known for his thunderous strategy and fierce fighting spirit, his weapon of choice is a large longbow that's almost 1.5 meters long along with a round shield used for defense is an extension of his personality—intimidating, precise, and impossible to block or dodge. His martial arts style is opposite of his straightforward and bold nature, focusing on precision, speed and overpowering opponents with sheer amount of arrows fired at once. His Star falling techniques add a devastating element to his attacks, capable of generating thousands of arrows just from one shot from his bow along with his special Qi abilities its almost like one is fighting a platoon of bow-men, the name it gets from the way the arrows look like falling stars.

While his bow abilities are unmatched, Jang Jin's greatest strength lies in his defense. He is an impenetrable wall, able to withstand an incredible amount of damage and shield those under his protection with his indomitable will. Whether it’s standing firm in battle or using his shield to deflect strikes, his primary goal is never to start a battle but to finish all of them—his bow striking power comes secondary to his protective nature. In battle, he’s a excellent strategies, ensuring the safety of the emperor, and the soldiers not losing a single person in any battle he was general in at the cost of his own well-being.

**Role in the Jeong Dynasty:** As the Royal Commandant, Jang Jin is the emperor’s personal guardian, his first line of defense. Though his humor and carefree attitude might seem out of place in such a serious role, Jang Jin is a master at balancing the two sides of his personality. His loyalty to the throne and his ability to protect the emperor at all costs make him indispensable. He’s seen as the Jeong Dynasty’s impenetrable shield, able to shrug off danger with a smile while using his overwhelming strategic mind to keep his charge safe.

Despite his playful nature, Jang Jin commands the respect of his peers and soldiers alike, all of whom understand that beneath the jokes and laughter is a warrior who will stand firm when it matters most. He is the protector who never hesitates to laugh in the face of danger but will do anything to ensure the safety of those he is sworn to defend.
