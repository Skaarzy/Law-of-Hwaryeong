**Gongsin (공신)** literally means "meritorious vassals/retainers" - people who earned titles and status through service rather than birth.

**What this district would include:**

- **Newly wealthy generals** who earned estates through military victories
- **Brilliant scholars** from common families who passed Royal exams
- **Successful merchants** who gained Royal favor and titles
- **Loyal administrators** promoted from lower ranks
- **War heroes** granted land and status

**District characteristics:**

- **Newer, grander houses** - showing off new wealth
- **Mix of architectural styles** - not traditional noble aesthetics
- **Ambitious atmosphere** - people trying to establish their new status
- **Some tension with hereditary nobles** - "new money" vs "old blood"

This creates great social dynamics and is completely historically accurate for Korean society! The merit-based promotion system was huge in Korean governance
