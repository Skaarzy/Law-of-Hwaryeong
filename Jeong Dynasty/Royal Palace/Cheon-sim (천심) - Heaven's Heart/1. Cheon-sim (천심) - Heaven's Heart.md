1. **Centralized Power**: The **Royal Palace** at the heart of the city surrounded by **noble districts**, **administrative areas**, and military defense, mimics the centralized control seen in historical capitals.

3. **Social Districts**: The **clear separation between districts** based on **social class** (e.g., **noble**, **middle-class**, and **common folk**) is a well-reflected feature of historical cities, where areas were organized based on status and function.
    
4. **Religious and Medical Functions of Temples**: The idea of **temples** serving dual purposes (both religious and as hospitals for the poor) is historically accurate, as temples were often involved in social welfare.

5. **Market Placement and Trade Routes**: The strategic placement of **marketplaces** along key roads, especially near the **main gates** and **important roads leading to the palace**, is true to the way **trade** and **commerce** were integrated into urban planning in **ancient cities**.
    
6. **Harbor Placement for Defense**: The **harbor outside the main city** but connected by the **city walls** adds historical realism, ensuring **trade access** while still prioritizing **defense**.
