Jang Hyeon (장현) - The Written Blade Sage
Saganwon (사간원, Censorate) (1229 - 1418)
Died: 1421 (killed in a battle against the heavenly demon)

**Role:** Royal Tutor, Elder of the Jeong Dynasty  
**Appearance:** An elderly figure, his long black beard and wise, calculating eyes reflect a lifetime of service to the Jeong Dynasty. Dressed in simple but dignified robes, Jang Hyeon exudes an aura of calm and intellect. He always holds his steel ink pen in his hand—its sleek, needle-like design, long and slender, giving little hint of the deadly power it holds. The pen serves as both a tool for his scholarly pursuits and a weapon of martial prowess.

**Personality:** Jang Hyeon is known throughout the Jeong Dynasty for his wisdom, calm demeanor, and highly calculated actions. Having served as tutor to every emperor and their children for generations, he has earned respect not just for his intellectual brilliance but also for his ability to navigate the complex politics of the Jeong Dynasty with unmatched precision. His advice is highly sought after, as he has always seen the bigger picture, weighing every decision with the experience of a man who has lived through countless regimes and seen the rise and fall of many. Despite his age, Jang Hyeon is sharp and composed, never hurried and always thinking two steps ahead. He is a man of great patience and insight, willing to wait for the right moment to act.

**Abilities and Martial Arts:** Though known primarily for his vast knowledge and role as an educator, Jang Hyeon is also a formidable martial artist, specializing in a unique fighting style that incorporates his steel ink pen. The pen, much larger than the average writing tool, serves as both a weapon and a symbol of his intellectual might. He uses it with extraordinary precision, wielding it like a needle to strike vital points and deliver precise blows with swift, calculated movements. The pen's thin steel blade is capable of slicing through the air with surgical accuracy, making it a fearsome weapon despite its inconspicuous appearance.But his main technique is illusion mastery which is said to bring worlds to life and if u cant escape them u get trapped in them forever he uses his pen as a conduit for activating the technique, which when activate on a person it looks like ink consumes everything then there is pitch black and then the world that Jang Hyeon traps u in appears, Jang Hyeon can enter and exit these worlds as he likes  and each world that has a person or people trapped have their names written on one page on his scroll which he carries with him everywhere.

Jang Hyeon has mastered an ancient scripture passed down through the generations, known only to a select few. When activated, this scripture imbues him with unmatched power, augmenting his already considerable martial abilities to the point of overpowering nearly any opponent. The scripture is said to allow him to channel the power of ink, drawing from the flow of written words to manifest devastating effects—whether through mental control, conjured weapons, or enhanced strikes. His true abilities are rarely seen, as he uses them only when necessary, preferring to rely on his intellect and wisdom to handle matters of the Jeong Dynasty.

**Role in the Jeong Dynasty:** As the Royal Tutor, Jang Hyeon has tutored emperors and their heirs, shaping the minds of rulers who will one day guide the Jeong Dynasty. His influence over the royal family is immeasurable, and his advice has been pivotal in shaping the policies and decisions of countless emperors. Yet, despite his significant power, Jang Hyeon is not one to seek the throne or any title of power for himself. His loyalty lies in ensuring the continued prosperity and stability of the Jeong Dynasty. He sees himself as a guardian of knowledge, tasked with passing on the wisdom of the ages to those who will lead the Jeong Dynasty into the future.

Though he is a quiet figure, Jang Hyeon’s presence is felt in every corner of the Jeong Dynasty. He is often sought out by the emperor for his wise counsel, and his status as a learned man gives him great influence over the court. Despite his old age, he continues to serve as a pillar of strength, intellect, and power, his calm demeanor belying the fierce martial artist who stands ready to defend the Jeong Dynasty should the need arise.

In times of crisis, when the Jeong Dynasty’s very survival is at stake, Jang Hyeon’s role transcends that of a tutor. He becomes a strategist, a warrior, and a protector of the realm, wielding his steel pen and the power of his scripture with deadly force.
