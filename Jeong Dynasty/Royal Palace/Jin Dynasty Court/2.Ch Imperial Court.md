### **The Positioning in court meetings** :
They where divided into Left State Councilor (좌의정, _Jwa-uijeong_) - Seated to the **left** of the king  and Right State Councilor (우의정, _U-uijeong_) Seated to the **right** of the king. This arrangement reflects the Confucian value of left-right orientation, where the left side is traditionally associated with higher status and authority and also was mostly filled with scholars. Additional officials were seated in descending order of rank, with the lower their positions further from the king indicating lower status.
The usual court looked like this :
- **King's Position**: The king sat at the **center** of the council hall, symbolizing his supreme authority.
- **Front row, in front of the king (from king's perspective):**
    - **Left side:** Left State Councilor in red (scholar)
        - **Behind the Left State Councilor:** Mostly high-ranking red officials, maybe a few mid-ranking blue (predominantly scholars with crane badges)
    - **Right side:** Right State Councilor in red(scholar)
        - **Behind the Right State Councilor:** Mix of blue (mid-rank) and some red (higher rank), often fewer reds than left side (more military with tiger badges)
