**정 (Jeong) 正 Dynasty** - _The Righteous Dynasty_  
正 = righteous, upright, correct, proper  
**The Righteous Royal Family**

Centuries ago, the **Ming Empire**, seeking influence over distant lands, discovered a continent ruled by **murim sects**, each wielding immense martial power. To manage diplomacy and trade, Ming established a modest **envoy village**, appointing a noble family of high status within the empire to govern it. Their task: maintain order, facilitate exchange, and ensure Ming’s interests were represented. Over decades, the envoy village prospered. It became a hub for merchants, scholars, and cultivators, valued by both the sects and the Ming empire. Ming formally recognized the ruling family, granting them sovereignty as a **vassal kingdom**, ensuring loyalty while cementing Ming’s presence on the continent.The kingdom acted as a stabilizing bridge: it maintained peace among the sects, prevented unorthodox factions from gaining power, and secured trade routes. Its prosperity grew steadily, earning respect from the sects, who saw no reason to interfere in a kingdom that posed no threat. When the Ming Empire’s ambition turned toward full conquest, the kingdoms rulers saw that the kingdom and themselves where abandoned and that they would be the first to face annihilation from the sects if war erupts. Recognizing this, the rulers of the Jeong Kingdom negotiated with the **Orthodox sects**: in exchange for military and logistical aid to resist Ming and also the promise of Independence from Ming, the kingdom would provide ship designs, trade routes, and intelligence, ensuring the empire could not dominate or even reach the continent. The sects agreed, and the combined resistance forced Ming to abandon its plans as they where losing to many men and resources with just trying to cross the sea. With their independence secured, the Jeong Kingdom declared sovereignty. Eventually after decades of building itself as a kingdom the Jeong Dynasty after striking a deal with the clans and absorbing their lands it proclaimed itself an **empire**. Its rulers claimed legitimacy not from foreign decree alone, but from decades of balancing power, wisdom, and martial order.
The **Jeong Dynasty** thus rose: born from diplomacy, survival, and cunning, its founders remembered as both clever envoys and heroic architects of independence. Over generations, the dynasty expanded its territory, influence, and culture, cementing its position as the first human empire capable of negotiating with both the martial sects and foreign powers alike. 

## Clan relationship with the Jeong Dynasty
At first the 5 clans where independent and considered part of the unorthodox sects , but after some time when they gained some power and land they where approached by the Jeong Dynasty which was a kingdom at that time which wanted to strike a deal with the 5 clans which stated: the Jeong Dynasty will accept the 5 clans under its wings and legitimize their position in the world as a clans and not a unorthodox sect, in return the clans must provide the Jeong Dynasty with its supplies and warriors if needed as well .Another rule was that the clan leaders must meet with the king once a year for a annual meeting where the status of wealth and economy of the clans is discussed and improved if necessary, and the clan leaders can also voice their problems and concerns if there are any.
This deal the kingdom offered may look like it gave too much to the clans but the kingdom had the support and backing of the orthodox sects which are considered the main martial power of the world which made the kingdom threaten the clans that if the do anything reckless the sects would inverter, in the end after some negotiation the clan leaders accepted the deal thus the unorthodox sects became official clans under the protection of the Jeong Dynasty and in return the clans offered the Jeong Dynasty :
