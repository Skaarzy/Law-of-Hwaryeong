### **SIMPLE DESCRIPTION**
You start as a **nobody**, handling **small missions** like errands, scouting, or assisting minor NPCs. These early tasks help you **learn the sect, meet NPCs, and prove your competence**.
[[Quest Template]]
- **NPC Tiers:**
    1. **Small/Minor NPCs** – Provide flavor, optional tasks, and small rewards.
    2. **Medium/Supporting NPCs** – Assign missions, give advice, and represent factions. Your style and choices influence what paths or subquests open.
    3. **Important/Key NPCs** – Leaders or elders. Supporting them can tip faction leadership, unlock major story branches, and shape the sect’s future.
    4. **Back to Medium NPCs** – After interacting with key NPCs, you return to **medium/supporting NPCs aligned with the side you chose**. These NPCs now provide follow-up unique missions, based on the side u choose , and reflect the consequences of your major choices.

- **Reputation & Style:**
    - Missions contribute points to one of three **style pools**:
        - **Stealth/Strategy** → careful, subtle actions
        - **Bold/Brute** → direct, aggressive actions
        - **Diplomatic/Clever** → negotiation and clever problem-solving

- NPCs notice your actions and approach based on your style and the side you support in conflicts.
[[Combat template]]
- **Mission Flow:**
    1. Receive mission → objectives, stakes, and NPC context.
    2. Choose how to act → stealth, brute force, or diplomacy.
    3. Consequences update reputation and influence story flavor.
    4. Optional subquests let you engage more deeply with favored NPCs.
    5. Return to medium NPCs aligned with your chosen key NPC for follow-ups, reputation growth, and additional content.

- **Long-Term Outcomes:**
    - Completing missions and making style-based choices unlocks **elite missions, mentorship from powerful NPCs, and unique rewards**.
    - Player **tip the balance gradually**, and repeated neglect or mistakes can give the opposing side an advantage — creating stakes without forcing a “fail state.”
    - Supporting a particular NPC or faction can **change sect leadership and story branches**.
    - The MC’s influence grows gradually, keeping them important without making them the ultimate world-decider.
    - Those that create fail state are not allies in the second part of the game

**Key Idea:** You rise from humble beginnings, your choices and approach define relationships across small, medium, and key NPCs, and supporting the right people shapes the sect’s story — all while keeping freedom, simplicity, and open exploration.


## **1. Core Concept**
- The MC starts as a nobody and serves as a **competent subordinate** rather than the ultimate hero.
- They participate in key events and battles but **don’t control world-defining outcomes**.
- Heroic status is **earned over time through reputation and competence**, not given automatically.

---
## **2. Reputation & Relationships**
- MC earns **faction/NPC reputation** based on missions and playstyle.
- NPCs/factions can:
    - Trust the MC more → assign higher-tier or sensitive missions
    - Trust less → reduce opportunities or influence future missions

- Player style subtly influences who notices them:
    - Stealthy/careful → liked by cautious or quiet NPCs
    - Bold/direct → liked by aggressive or decisive NPCs
    - Diplomatic/clever → liked by intellectual or political NPCs

- NPC relationships can **conflict or coexist**:
    - Some NPCs oppose each other → MC choices may favor one over the other
    - Some NPCs are friendly but prefer different MC approaches → MC can satisfy both in different ways

---
## **3. Mission Structure**

Each mission follows this general template:
1. **Setup**:
    - Who assigns the mission, why it matters, objectives, and conditions.

2. **NPCs & Stakes**:
    - Show affected parties and hint how reputation with certain NPCs may be impacted.

3. **Choices / Tactical Style**:
    - 2–4 meaningful decisions that affect **NPC reputation, dialogue, or relationships**, not mission failure.
    - Example: Stealth, direct combat, negotiation, or choice of ally.

4. **Consequences / Feedback**:
    - Immediate: Mission completed, casualties, or outcome narrative.
    - Short-term: NPC dialogue changes, minor story variations, reputation adjustments.
    - Long-term: Unlocking new missions, shaping future opportunities, influencing which NPCs take notice.

5. **Wrap-Up**:
    - Reputation is updated and narrative reflects MC’s performance.
    - Small variations accumulate across missions, subtly influencing future arcs.

---
## **4. Reputation in Action**
- Each mission can have **subtext reputation gains** for multiple NPCs:

|Action / Style|Reputation Effect|
|---|---|
|Stealthy|+First Master (values discretion)|
|Direct Combat|+Second Master (values bold action)|
|Diplomatic / Clever|+Third Master (values negotiation)|

- The MC doesn’t gain “skill points”—the player’s **approach influences who notices them and assigns future missions**.

---
## **5. Long-Term Outcomes**
- Positive relationships unlock access to elite NPCs, sensitive assignments, and eventually hero-level opportunities (meeting emperors, commanding elite units).
- Choosing sides or favoring certain NPCs can create:
    - Minor rivalries
    - Exclusive mission paths
    - Different story flavors in later arcs
- **No mission failure breaks the world**, but choices shape the MC’s **trajectory and potential rise to influence**.

---
## **6. Overall Flow**
1. MC starts as a nobody → completes minor missions, earns trust.
2. Tactical choices influence **NPC reputation** and small story details.
3. As reputation grows, **higher-tier assignments and elite NPCs appear**.
4. Consistent positive performance may lead to **heroic-level recognition**, but the MC always remains one step removed from ultimate world-changing decisions.
5. Early mistakes may limit access or shape future interactions but **don’t break the main story**, keeping the world alive and consistent.

---
This system:
- Keeps the MC **important but not central**,
- Rewards **player choices meaningfully**,
- Creates **dynamic, living relationships** with NPCs,
- And allows for **organic heroism** if the player earns it.




# Example of a Questline
## **1. Tutorial/Intro**
- MC arrives at **Plum Blossom Sect**.
- Meets the person recommended by the old elder (introductory NPC).
- Basic tutorial and first impression—ignore tutorial mechanics as you said.

---
## **2. First Minor Quest Chain**
**Goal:** Familiarize the MC with sect structure, key NPCs, and basic mechanics.  
**Flow:**

1. **Master’s Assignment:** “Go visit General X to learn basic combat.”
2. **General X:** Introduces MC to other NPCs and gives tasks:
    - Speak with **Blacksmith** → repair/enhance weapon.
    - Speak with **Stableman** → get horses, armor, mounts.
3. **Return to Master:** Reports completion. Master introduces **accountant, elders, and other important NPCs**.

**Purpose:**
- Establish MC’s **supportive role**.
- Begin building **NPC relationships** organically.
- Prepare player for **first “big mission.”**

---
## **3. First Big Mission (Reputation Trigger)**
**Goal:** Prove MC can stay in the sect as an outsider.  
**Mission Examples:**
- Escort VIP to sect border.
- Protect sect assets from minor threat.
- Solve internal sect dispute.

**Choices / Tactical Approach:**
- How the MC completes the mission influences **which important NPC(s) notice them**:
    - Stealthy/clever approach → appeals to quiet/strategic NPC.
    - Bold/aggressive approach → appeals to martial NPC.
    - Diplomatic/flexible approach → appeals to political/financial NPC.

**Consequences:**
- Each NPC gains **favorable opinion / reputation points**.
- May create minor tension: if one NPC favors MC strongly, a rival NPC may dislike them.

---
## **4. Post-Mission Reputation System (Updated)**
- **High reputation with an NPC → unlocks a unique side quest for that NPC.**
- **Unique Quest Mechanics:**
    - Must be completed in the style **preferred by that NPC**.
        - Example:
            - NPC favors stealth → mission must be done quietly, avoiding detection.
            - NPC favors direct action → mission requires bold combat approach.
            - NPC favors diplomacy → mission requires negotiation, clever manipulation, or careful persuasion.
- **Rewards:**
    - Unique items, dialogue options, or access to elite NPCs.
    - NPC who favors MC gains more influence in future debates.

- **Failure to follow preferred style:**
    - Reduces reputation or prevents unlocking the NPC’s unique rewards.
    - May even tilt favor toward a rival NPC if another is observing MC’s performance.

**Key Idea:**
- This ties player choice directly to **NPC approval**, reinforcing that MC’s rise depends on **aligning actions with who they want to impress**, not just completing missions arbitrarily.

---
## **5. Mid-Late Mission Chain**
- MC continues completing standard missions + optional unique quests for favored NPCs.
- **Key Feature:** NPCs compete for influence in sect decisions.
- **MC Influence:** Completing their unique quests tips their chosen NPC’s side in debates or decisions.

**Example:**
- Debate: “Do we form a new combat unit or not?”
- MC completed unique missions for NPC A → NPC A’s proposal is adopted.
- Other NPCs may resent MC, creating rivalries for future missions.

---
## **6. Summary of Reputation & Outcomes**
- **MC is never the ultimate decider**—they influence outcomes by **helping favored NPCs succeed**.
- Choices shape:
    - Which NPC notices MC.
    - Who trusts them with sensitive missions.
    - What unique rewards or missions become available.
- Hero-level influence (meeting emperor, high-stakes assignments) is **earned gradually through consistent reputation**.

---
### ✅ Key Points of This System
1. **Player agency is tactical and relational**, not world-defining.
2. **Reputation with NPCs drives access** to higher-tier content and unique missions.
3. **Early mission performance matters**—it affects later opportunities and which NPCs favor MC.
4. **World moves independently**, but MC choices tip debates and shape outcomes for certain factions.
5. **Replayability is high**, as different playstyles unlock different NPC paths and rewards.

It would make the system super easy to apply to multiple sects or factions.
