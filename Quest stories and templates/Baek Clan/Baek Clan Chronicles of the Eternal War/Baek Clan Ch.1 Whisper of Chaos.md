While MC is in his clan after the year 15 tutorials there are sub quests specific for each clan but all being around the weird things happening with a elder or parent of the MC taking the MC around to help complete those things while some even being a standalone quests which are simpler like go gather herbs or wood or something similar but the main base of the sub quests starts simple as like go gather things or hunt or whatever in all those sub quest in couple there are weird things happening but all have normal explanations like shipwreck or animal attack and so on

For Baek clan its mostly about fishing expeditions , and weird sunken ships in he sea where there are body parts found , also fishers finding rotten and half eaten fish all around the Baek province.
First couple of quests make the MC go around all the villages of the province first to gather info on the food supplies and if there are any problems but at the last village there is the case of rotten fish and half eaten fish, which mc brings up after he returns back to his father who then leads the expedition to that part of the province to see if anything is weird where they find a sunken ship and blood and human parts around it they search around the area and find a shark floating dead with a large dent in its side its not a bite but almost like it hit a ship which the father of mc says is the reason for its death and they return back saying a fishermen ship fought a shark that was caught in their fishing net and ate trough it escaping and opening the net making fish that are half eaten and dead escape the net which the lead the fishermen ship to chase it and hit it killing it but then possibly when it hit the ship it made a hole in it and the ship sunk as well, which seemed kind of weird but mc father said :
"that is the luck of the sea most things that are unexpected happen all the time ""
