_The Clan Leader approaches slowly, his expression grave. The Old Mentor looks up from his meditation._

**Clan Leader** _(calmly, but with deep sorrow)_:  
"I'm sorry. Your father... he won't be coming back from his fishing expedition."

**MC**: "What? No... that can't be right. He said he'd be back by sunset..."

**Clan Leader**: "The storm that hit three days ago was fiercer than anyone expected. We found pieces of his boat washed up on the eastern shore this morning."

**MC** _(shaking head)_: "No! He's probably just taking shelter somewhere! He knows those waters better than anyone!"

---

## The Mentor's Harsh Wisdom

**Old Mentor** _(gruffly)_:  
"You brat, calm down. He is where he belongs now. It's a good thing that the sea took him - better the sea than pirates."

**MC** _(angrily turning to mentor)_: "Master! How can you say that?!"

**Old Mentor** _(unmoved by the outburst)_:  
"You'll realize this when you grow older, but all people have their end. Only the deities are forever."

_The MC's anger slowly deflates into quiet grief._

---

## The Clan's Ultimatum

**Clan Leader** _(stepping forward, placing a hand on MC's shoulder)_:  
"Young man, your father is gone - be it for better or worse how he died, he is gone. Now it's up to you if you want to take his place or leave the clan. I know all of this is too sudden, but I must act fast before others come and try to pressure you to choose. I am here to tell you - live as you want."

**MC**: "WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN? Why can't I just stay here with Master? I don't want any position, I just want to keep training with..."

**Old Mentor** _(interrupting)_:  
"OF COURSE U CANT, U BRAT U KNOW THE RULES! Your parents are dead and you are the only one left from your father's lineage. You know the clan rules - if the Second-in-Command dies, either their successor takes over or the remnants of their family are banished. It's a cruel rule, but it makes sure none try to take over the Clan Leader's place."

**MC**: "But Master, you know I don't want the Clan Leader's place! I just want to live like this—"

**Old Mentor** _(cutting him off, raising his voice)_:  
"I KNOW YOU BRAT, but still it's the rule! If it's ignored here, then others might take advantage of that, thinking our clan is weak. I am sorry, brat, but you must choose - stay and become Second-in-Command, or leave and write your own story."

---

## Support and Understanding

**Clan Leader**: "Nobody will judge you whatever you choose."

**Old Mentor** _(softening slightly)_:  
"I will support you the best way I can. I have ties to most clans and even the Jeong Dynasty - made them when your grandfather was alive, in case things went wrong with the clan back then. But I can use one of them for you, so I can get you in wherever you want to go."

## The Funeral Ceremony

_Three days later, the scene transitions to the funeral home. The MC stands solemnly in traditional Korean funeral attire - white hemp clothing of the chief mourner, marking him as the eldest son. Before him sits his father's portrait, painted in careful ink strokes, surrounded by mountains of offerings: rice, fruits, incense, and his father's favorite fishing tools._

_There is no coffin - the sea claimed it as piece of it. Instead, the ceremony centers around the portrait and the memories held in every clan member's heart._

**Funeral Singer** _(in traditional chant)_:  
"Oh departed soul, hear our call... Go peacefully into the endless waters, find calm beyond the waves... Your son is here to say goodbye to you as you depart and your clan mourns..."

_The procession moves slowly toward the family shrine. The MC carries his father's portrait with trembling hands, his face a mask of controlled grief. Behind him, clan members wail and call out:_

**Clan Members** _(crying out)_:  
"Please accept our Baek Hyunwoo! Please accept the soul of our, Second-in-Command! He gave his life to you—now accept him!"

_At the shrine, where the names of all main family bloodline members are engraved in stone, the MC carefully places his father's portrait. His hands shake as he sets it down. Later, the stonemason will add his father's name to join the ancestors._

**Clan Leader** _(standing beside MC, hand on his back)_:  
"He lived with honor. The sea took an honorable man."

_The MC's composure finally cracks. His eyes tear up but he controls them by nt letting a single one fall as the reality settles in. The funeral concludes with the traditional three bows, and slowly, the clan members disperse, leaving the MC alone with his grief._

---

## The Morning After - The Choice

_Dawn breaks quietly. The Old Mentor enters the MC's room without ceremony, his weathered face serious but calm._

**Old Mentor** _(sitting beside the MC's bed)_:  
"Young Master, we need to talk. What do you want to do?"

**MC** _(voice hoarse from crying through the night)_: "I... I don't know, Master."

**Old Mentor**: "Your father's funeral is over. The clan has mourned. Now comes the living - and the choosing. You remember what I said about my connections?"

**MC**: _(nodding weakly)_

**Old Mentor**: "Listen carefully. If you choose to leave, I can get you into several places. I have relationships built over decades - favors owed, old friendships, alliances your grandfather helped me forge."

_The mentor pauses, studying his student's face._

**Old Mentor**: "But you need to understand what you're choosing between. Stay, and you become Second-in-Command of this clan - with all the power and all the chains that come with it. Leave, and you're free to write your own story, but you'll be walking away from everything you've known."

**MC**: "Master... what would you do?"

**Old Mentor** _(gruffly)_: "I'm not you. Young master, only you can choose your path. But know this - whatever you decide i will be beside u, but once decided there's no going back. The clan won't let you return if you leave, and if you stay, you'll be fighting those who want to claim your fathers position neither path will be easy."

_The room falls silent except for the morning birds outside._

**Old Mentor**: "Take your time, but not too much time. Clan elders are already watching, waiting to see what the young heir will do."

## The Crucial Decision

**CHOICE POINT**

### Option A: Stay with the Beak Clan

_"I'll take father's place. The clan needs me, and... maybe I need them too."_

**Outcome**:

- Become Second-in-Command of Beak Clan
- Gain access to exclusive Beak Clan secret techniques
- Continue main storyline within clan structure
- Face the Eternal War as part of established clan hierarchy
- Unlock unique clan-based story paths and martial arts

### Option B: Leave and Explore the World

_"I need to find my own path. I can't stay here anymore - there are too many nightmares."_

**Outcome**:

- Leave Beak Clan territory
- Mentor will use his connections to help you
- **Sub-choices unlock based on mentor's relationships**:
    - **Join Orthodox Sects**: Learn righteous martial arts, fight for justice
    - **Serve the Jeong Dynasty**: Gain political power, military techniques, court intrigue
    - **Walk the Solo Path**: Maximum freedom, unique encounters, self-taught techniques
- Face the Demon War with chosen allegiance or as independent warrior

---

## Closing

**Old Mentor** _(regardless of choice)_:  
"ok, brat, remember what I taught you. Strength isn't just in your fists - it's in knowing when to use them. Your father knew that - he chose the simple life, and the sea took him simply."

_He stands to leave, then pauses at the door._

**Old Mentor**: "There are worse fates in this world than dying as yourself. Remember that."

_The tutorial concludes as the MC faces their first real choice, with the weight of loss, the echo of funeral songs, and the promise of an uncertain future ahead. The morning sun streams through the window, illuminating both the portrait of his father and the path forward._

Later in the game once mc plays through some parts of the game somewhere in the middle of the demon war there should be a quest (only if mc stayed in the clan after the choice) where a massive whale which is corrupted and became demonic starts wrecking and causing chaos to the Baek clans ships.
## Technical Notes for Implementation

**If Player Chooses Clan Path**:

- Unlock Beak Clan skill tree
- Set faction_loyalty = "Beak_Clan"
- Enable clan-specific NPCs and storylines
- Begin "Rise of the Second-in-Command" questline
- Add father's memorial shrine as visitable location

**If Player Chooses Exploration Path**:

- Unlock world map with mentor's connections available
- Set faction_loyalty = "Independent"
- Enable faction selection sub-menu with mentor's help
- Begin "Wanderer's Journey" questline with connection bonuses
- Mentor's recommendation letters provide faction entry bonuses

**Inherited Items**:

- Father's simple armor and fishing gear (sentimental value)
- Family seal (proof of lineage)
- Mentor's recommendation letter
- Father's portrait (can be carried or left at shrine)

## Core Mechanic
A single boss encounter that appears differently based on player's chosen path:

**Baek Clan Stayed Path:**
- MC recognizes father's sword embedded in whale's flesh
- Fight becomes personal revenge changing the script: "That's my father's blade! This beast killed him!"
- Can retrieve father's sword as unique reward
- Emotional closure for father's death storyline

**All Other Paths (Solo/Jeong Dynasty/Orthodox/Other Clans):**
- Same whale encounter, but MC doesn't recognize the sword
- Treats it as random demon boss with the sword not being a lootable item
- Player literally fights father's killer (or the killer of the baek clan second in command if another clan playthrough) without knowing it.
- Creates tragic irony - the truth is right there but invisible

## Impact

- Makes clan choice meaningful beyond just different skills
- Creates devastating realization on second playthroughs
- Some truths only accessible through specific life choices
- Perfect example of narrative consequences tied to player agency
