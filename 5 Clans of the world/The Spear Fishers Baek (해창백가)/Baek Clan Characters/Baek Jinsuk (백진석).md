**Baek Jinsuk (백진석)** - The Golden Wave , the eldest son of the clan leader, is a man of blunt honesty and decisive action. He speaks plainly and doesn’t tolerate foolishness, often cutting through nonsense with a sharp tongue and a sharper mind. Jinsuk is known for following his gut instinct, making quick decisions that often prove effective, even if they surprise others. He is next in line to become the clan leader but lives mostly in seclusion, rarely visiting the busy streets of the main town. His distance from daily life adds to his air of mystery and command. Jinsuk prefers comfort and practicality over formality, usually seen wearing loose, worn clothes that allow for ease of movement. A pipe is almost always clenched between his teeth, the smoke curling lazily around his rugged, weathered face. His long, messy hair falls untamed around his shoulders, contrasting with a small, neatly kept beard that frames his stern, unwavering eyes—eyes that seem to see through pretense and hesitation. Jinsuk’s presence is commanding yet straightforward, a man who values action over words and respects strength and clarity above all else.
