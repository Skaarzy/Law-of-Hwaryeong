Baek Hyunwoo (백현우) The Calm Tide
**Baek Hyunwoo** is a tall, muscular man whose presence commands respect without needing to raise his voice and the second child of the clan leader [[Baek Jun-goo (백준구)]]. His long black hair, often tied back, frames a weathered but composed face marked by a thick sailor’s beard—an emblem of his years at sea and his steadfast nature. Known for his calm and calculating mind, Hyunwoo approaches every situation with measured thought and quiet confidence. While he is naturally reserved and often appears distant, those close to him know the warmth and unwavering loyalty he holds for his family.His brother [[Baek Jinsuk (백진석)]] the first child of the clan leader is more of a blunt and straight to the point person who doesn't suffer fools and is most quick to decide things following his gut. Though once offered the chance to become the clan’s next leader, Hyunwoo respectfully declined, adhering to the clan’s strict traditions that favor the eldest sibling. Instead, he devoted himself to mastering his weapon of choice—a spear—becoming a formidable warrior whose strength and precision are matched only by his discipline. Now serving as the Baek clan’s second in command, Hyunwoo leads and plans the clan’s vital fishing expeditions with the same strategic mind and steady hand that define his character. His steady demeanor and sense of duty make him a pillar within the clan: a man who balances authority and gentleness, a protector who fights not for glory, but for the safety and honor of those he loves.
