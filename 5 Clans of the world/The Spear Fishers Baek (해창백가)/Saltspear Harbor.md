Saltspear Harbor - Capital of Spear Fishers Baek (Haechang Province)

A weathered harbor settlement carved into salt-worn cliffs, looking more like a large fishing village than a proper city. Wooden piers stretch into storm-battered waters where Baek fishing boats and naval vessels dock. Buildings are simple - driftwood and stone with clay tiles, built low and sturdy against the constant sea winds.

**Key Features:**

- **The Great Docks:** Massive wooden pier complex where the Baek fishing fleet and Royal naval vessels dock
- **Spear Forges:** Simple waterfront workshops where master smiths craft the clan's legendary fishing spears
- **Storm Watchtowers:** Stone towers on cliff edges to spot incoming weather and enemy ships
- **The Tanning Yards:** Where the sun-darkened Baek work leather and prepare their catches
- **Tide Markets:** Busy waterfront markets that change with the tides, full of maritime goods

The tanned, practical Baek people work constantly - mending nets, forging spears, loading ships. Even the clan head lives in a modest stone house overlooking the harbor. No fancy mansions, just honest work and the smell of salt and dried fish everywhere.


# Baek Clan Village Locations - Enhanced Descriptions

## **[2. Old Customs Post]**

Once a vital checkpoint for merchants who feared far more than losing mere coin, this building served as an important gateway for trade in more dangerous times. However, after the Jeong Dynasty established their precious guild office, this place became as useful as a broken net, its purpose forgotten like yesterday's catch. Now the structure stands as little more than a crumbling monument to better days, home to nothing but bugs, rats, and bitter memories that cling to its rotting walls. The building appears ready to collapse at any moment, its wooden beams sagging under layers of mold and moss, while the roof sits half-missing like a gap-toothed smile. Yet beneath this decay lies a secret - smugglers have claimed the ruins as their own, using a hidden entrance that leads to an underground cellar where forbidden goods change hands in the dead of night.

## **[3. Net Mender's Yard]**

This massive yard sprawls with fishing nets draped like giant spider webs across wooden frames, tended by weathered hands that have seen decades of sea spray. Mostly older folk who can no longer brave the dangerous waters gather here, their fingers still nimble enough to mend tears and weave new nets with practiced ease. Located directly across from the fish gutting pier, the yard sits next to the smokehouse, making this entire area a bustling hub of activity filled with the constant chatter of elders sharing tales of old times and erupting into hearty laughter. Here, the same hands that repair nets also stitch wounds when needed, while tongues wag with the latest gossip, making this space a vital heart of the Baek clan as it supplies the fishers with the essential equipment needed to bring food to every table.

## **[4. Fish-Gutting Pier]**

Stretching out over the water on a pier constructed from dark wood that has absorbed years of fish blood until it gained its distinctive crimson-brown color, this workplace allows only those who truly know their craft. The planks beneath are perpetually slippery with scales and gore, while the air hangs thick with a foul stench that would turn most stomachs - only those who have labored here for years have grown accustomed to the overwhelming smell. Fortunately, the smoke from the nearby smokehouse drifts over to overpower the worst of it, if only by a little. This pier serves as more than just a gutting station; it's where the valuable fish bait is prepared for upcoming expeditions, ensuring that nothing from the sea's bounty goes to waste.

## **[5. Smokehouse Row]**

The smokehouse stands as perhaps the most crucial building in the entire clan, where skilled elders who have mastered the ancient art of smoking carefully tend and retrieve dried food that will feed the people through harsh seasons. The smoke billows so thick and acrid that visitors can barely keep their eyes open, yet these weathered masters breathe easily and peer directly into the choking clouds without so much as a wince. The building itself is an enclosed structure crowned by a massive opening instead of a traditional roof, allowing the precious smoke to escape while trapping the flavors within. Every type of seafood imaginable gets smoked within these walls, and villagers from distant settlements make pilgrimages here to secure their winter supplies. The smokehouse has also earned fame as a gathering spot where drunkards and sailors converge at night, drawn by the promise of late-night snacks and warm fellowship.

## **[6. The Eight-Legged Drum]**

This rowdy tavern draws drunkards from across the village who come not just to drink, but to engage in spirited brawls purely for entertainment. The establishment even offers a free drink to anyone bold enough to knock out another patron, though there exists only one sacred rule: don't speak trash if you can't back up your words with your fists. Fortunately, these wild festivities are only permitted three nights per week, and during all other times this place transforms into a peaceful and respectful establishment where traveling sailors can find refuge and drink while enduring long voyages away from home.

## **[7. Harbor Office]**

This imposing structure claims fame as the most luxurious building in the entire province, a testament to the Jeong Dynasty's wealth and influence since they both constructed and maintain it. The office serves as the Jeong Dynasty's primary communication hub, where important messages flow in and out like the tide itself. The building even houses its own contingent of Royal guards who possess the authority to implement new laws when deemed necessary, though most days pass peacefully as the office focuses on its primary function of maintaining communication with the distant Jeong Dynasty.

## **[8. Geumhyang Trading Hall]**

Within these newer walls built by the powerful Li trading company, guild records are meticulously kept, tariffs are calculated down to the last copper, and yes, even bribes discreetly change hands. This building stands as the fruit of an exclusive deal struck between the clan and the Li company - in exchange for trading solely with them, the Baek clan receives significant discounts from other factions that maintain business relationships with the Li Jeong Dynasty. This arrangement has transformed the hall into a vital trading post that delivers most goods that cannot be produced within the clan's own territory.

## **[9. Tide Shrine for Ancestors]**

A magnificent Korean stele rises from the edge of the rocky shore, positioned so perfectly that the crashing waves never seem to touch its sacred surface. Local legend claims this monument was erected by the very founder of the Baek clan himself, though none now living can confirm such ancient tales. The stone bears the carefully carved engravings of each clan leader and family member who has passed into legend, creating a genealogy written in granite. This hallowed ground serves as the place where the living pay their deepest respects to the dead Baek founders, while also functioning as a powerful good luck charm - sailors believe the ancestral spirits will guide and protect them on every perilous journey they undertake.

## **[10. Salt Works – in the distance]**

Even from the village, the distant dust clouds and rhythmic sounds of pickaxes striking stone and sieves shaking can be heard drifting on the wind like an industrial heartbeat. This location houses the source of the Baek clan's main export: precious sea salt that generates more income than even a golden mine could promise. Workers from every corner of the known world labor here, drawn by the steady wages paid directly by the Jeong Dynasty, who serves as the primary purchaser of this white gold that seasons tables across the realm.

## **[11. Red Lantern Street – daytime]**

During daylight hours, this narrow street presents a picture of innocent domesticity, with children playing games between the houses while residents share laughter and casual conversation. However, as darkness falls, this same thoroughfare undergoes a sinister transformation - windows slam shut, doors lock tight, and no soul dares enter or exit their homes. The street's namesake red lanterns, numbering well over a hundred, ignite one by one in a crimson procession, and shadowy figures emerge from dark corners into the lanterns' bloody glow. This becomes a dangerous realm where people conduct illegal deals, gamble with desperate stakes, and issue or accept contracts for murder or crushing loan debts.

## **[12. Outer Training Yard]**

This compact arena sits surrounded by a sturdy wooden wall, its ground covered with special sand that manages to be both soft enough to cushion falls yet sharp enough to remind fighters of their mistakes. People gather here regularly to hone their skills on the designated training ground, which is clearly marked by logs arranged in a perfect circle - step outside this boundary during a duel and you must immediately forfeit. The yard gains particular popularity during evening hours when warriors arrive fresh from a night of drinking, eager to train and duel each other in friendly competition before stumbling home.

## **[13. The Weathered Anchor Tavern]**

This establishment presents a more refined atmosphere compared to other drinking holes, catering primarily to elderly patrons and common folk who prefer conversation to chaos. The tavern offers a limited but carefully prepared selection of meals alongside their drinks, while the centerpiece remains a massive whale jaw that was claimed by a previous clan leader and gifted to the establishment as a cherished memento. Many visitors appear old and seemingly past their prime, yet these weathered souls possess the most fascinating tales - it's said that every clan leader in the Baek lineage has found enlightenment within these walls, inspired by the stories shared by the wise elders who frequent this sanctuary.

## **[14. The Blood Kelp Pot]**

This unique establishment functions as both inn and tavern, serving exclusively as accommodation for the hardworking laborers from the distant salt mines. The building and all meals within are maintained by the Jeong Dynasty itself, providing free food and lodging for the weary workers who toil in the salt fields. While any visitor can technically enter and be served, those who are not mine workers must pay premium prices that reflect the establishment's Royal backing and exclusive nature. Most people in the village pay little attention to this place, understanding it serves a specific purpose for a specific class of worker, making it feel somewhat isolated despite being open to all.

## **[15. Guards Tavern]**

Positioned on the upper level of the village where the more official buildings reside, this exclusive drinking establishment caters solely to guards and warriors who return from dangerous expeditions beyond the clan's borders. The tavern only opens its doors at night, creating an atmosphere of secrecy and camaraderie among those who risk their lives for the clan's protection. Entry requires explicit permission from the appropriate authorities, ensuring that only those who have earned the right through service can enjoy the sanctuary this establishment provides for the village's protectors.

## **[16. Saltblade Garrison]**

This heavily fortified facility shares a building with the storehouse but remains completely separate thanks to a solid wall that divides the structure in half. The garrison maintains constant vigilance with guards posted around the clock in rotating shifts, ensuring no moment passes without watchful eyes protecting its contents. Only individuals bearing the clan leader's personal permission may enter these secure chambers, which house emergency supplies of weapons, armor, and carriages reserved for times of war or crisis. The facility also stores a large arsenal of ship cannons and other naval warfare equipment, ready to be deployed should sea battles threaten the clan's waters.

## **[17. Saltwind Storehouse]**

Connected to the garrison but serving a distinctly different purpose, this massive storage facility houses the clan's vital supplies of food, salt, and animal feed that sustain the entire community. The same guards who protect the garrison circle this entire building in their patrol routes, ensuring both halves of the structure remain secure at all times. Access requires permission from the second-in-command, reflecting the critical importance of these supplies to the clan's survival. The interior must be maintained in pristine condition - clean and dry - to preserve the stored goods that could mean the difference between prosperity and starvation during harsh seasons.

## **[18. Main Pavilion]**

Rising majestically from the highest point in the village like a crown jewel overlooking its domain, this four-story pagoda-style building serves as the private residence of the clan leader and his children. The architecture displays intricate details and craftsmanship that borders on royal elegance, befitting the status of those who call it home. A protective wall encircles the entire compound, patrolled by dedicated guards who ensure the safety of the clan's most important family members. Within the walls lies a spacious courtyard garden and private stables for the finest horses, while the elevated position provides commanding views of every corner of the village below, symbolizing the leader's watchful care over all his people.

## **[19. The Big Clan Forge]**

This facility rivals even the smokehouse in terms of importance to the clan, as it produces most of the weapons that Baek warriors wield in battle. Four skilled blacksmiths labor within, though only one holds the exalted title of grand blacksmith - a master craftsman who has forged weapons for the last three clan leaders and is said to understand fire better than he understands water itself. The massive structure, built from solid stone blocks, houses an enormous forge within its inner garden that roars with flames day and night. Beyond its practical purpose, the forge serves as a meeting point where the clan leader and his most trusted subordinates gather after dark to forge new strategies and share stories beneath the hypnotic dance of the forge fire.

## **[20. The Broke Fang Flask]**

Standing as the village's only restaurant and undisputed favorite dining establishment, this welcoming place draws sailors who immediately rush here after completing long voyages to finally eat their fill of proper food. The restaurant features a spacious outdoor terrace that faces the endless sea, offering diners a view that reminds them why they brave the waters. The establishment also serves a diplomatic function, transforming itself into an elegant venue when important guests such as Royal inspectors require proper accommodation and fine dining.

## **[21. Bimu Ground]**

Though smaller than the main training yard, this space serves a vital purpose as the training ground for younger and less experienced warriors who are still learning the fundamentals of combat. Similar to the outer training yard, these practice areas are clearly marked by logs that define the boundaries, though this ground lacks the walls or barriers that surround its larger counterpart, giving it a more open and accessible feeling for nervous beginners.

## **[22. Drydock/Shipwright's Bay]**

This specialized maritime facility serves as the village's primary ship repair and maintenance center, featuring three distinct ports that allow up to three vessels to be serviced simultaneously. The shipwright's bay operates on a strict hierarchy of priority - clan ships, Li trading company vessels, and Royal ships receive immediate service and repairs without question or payment. All other vessels must pay substantial fees and wait in queue until a shipbuilder becomes available to assist them, creating a clear distinction between privileged and paying customers. Located adjacent to the normal docking area where ships park and unload their cargo, this facility remains separate from regular maritime traffic, ensuring that repair work doesn't interfere with the constant flow of fishing boats and merchant vessels. The skilled shipwrights who labor here possess the expertise to handle everything from minor hull patches to complete refurbishing, making this bay essential for maintaining the clan's naval capabilities and honoring their exclusive agreements with powerful allies.
