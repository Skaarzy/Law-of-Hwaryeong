**Dust Crown Settlement** - Capital of Night Runners Song (Dalpo Province)

A seemingly ordinary city nestled in muddy, overgrown swampland's that becomes mysteriously quiet after dark. During the day, it looks unremarkable - modest wooden houses with traditional Korean tiled roofs built on stilts above the muddy ground.The swampland is quite mysterious and more dangerous than normal swampland as its located near the mysterious Ink-Root Forest which is also said why the dalpo province was usually made out of beggars and those who don't have anywhere to go as the whole region around those two provinces is considered cursed and evil.The Song Clan has a large underground black market in the mountains of the dalpo province which is the largest one on the continent its location being underground helps the entrances and exits be scattered around the province and are far away from the main market which not only protects the black market but also make it so only those who know the routes can enter it .

**Key Features:**

- **The Tea House District:** Ordinary-looking buildings that host elegant musical performances
- **Lotus Pavilions:** Beautiful but modest structures built over the swampy waters
- **The Silent Streets:** Roads that empty completely when night falls
- **Hidden Performance Halls:** Secret venues disguised as normal houses
- **The Misty Gardens:** Overgrown areas where the Jang practice their defensive dance techniques

Everything seems normal and unremarkable during daylight - people go about regular business, children play, merchants sell goods. But when darkness falls, the streets empty and the city transforms. Soft music drifts from hidden halls where the Jang conduct their real cultural influence work.
