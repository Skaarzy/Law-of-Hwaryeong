A separate unit exists within the Song Clan, one that answers **only to the clan leader**. This force is not used for ordinary missions or simple tasks. Its sole purpose is to **protect the clan leader**, **maintain internal order** within the clan itself, and to assassinate anyone the leader commands—without question.

The unit’s true name is never recorded; even the elders refer to it only as _the Silent Division_. Its members are handpicked by the clan leader from across the organization—fighters, spies, and assassins whose loyalty is absolute and whose existence is erased from official records. When not deployed, they blend back into the clan’s ranks, appearing as ordinary villagers.

The Silent Division is rarely seen in action. They intervene only when the internal balance of the clan is threatened—particularly if an elder violates clan law, attempts to seize power, or if the clan leader orders an assassination outside the clan. In such cases, the unit acts without warning or hesitation. The punishment is swift, and the message is clear: **no one stands above the clan leader’s will or command**.They whole as a unit have parts of the Secrete Clan technique but are limited of use , also their demeanor and the way they act is somewhat like they have been brainwashed.Their look is also somewhat weird as they are dressed in all black yet have the colorful and somewhat happy looking Hahoe Masks.

The commander of this unit [[Hoon-sik (훈식)]] is a frail, unassuming old man who appears to be nothing more than a quiet attendant within the clan compound. None realize that he leads the most dangerous force the Song Clan has ever created. When the mask is donned and the unit is summoned, his demeanor changes entirely—calm, detached, yet lethally efficient. His identity is known only to the clan leader, and even the elders speak of him with caution.

Legends within the clan whisper that the old man has served under multiple leaders, his life prolonged by forbidden techniques. Whether this is true or simply rumor, no one dares ask.The Silent Division answers to no elder, no council, and no law but the will of the clan leader.
