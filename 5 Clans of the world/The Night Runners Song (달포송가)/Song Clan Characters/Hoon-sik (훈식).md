**Hoon-sik (훈식) — The Shadow Demon**

A frail, unassuming old man, Hoon-sik appears to be nothing more than a quiet attendant within the clan compound. His clothes are plain, his posture humble, and a long scar runs from his left eye across his forehead — the kind of mark no one dares ask about. By all accounts, he’s a simple, approachable man who spends his days weaving and selling baskets, mats, and boxes of _wancho_ (sedge) at a small stand.
But when the Clan Leader calls for him, something changes. Once he dons his lion dance mask, the gentle craftsman disappears. What remains is an empty vessel — silent, mechanical, and utterly obedient. Some whisper that the mask itself is cursed, or that it was once used in forbidden rituals. No one dares to ask which rumor is true.
Hoon-sik commands the **Silent Division**, though no one, not even the Clan Leader, can say when he first took that role — or how old he truly is. The techniques he and his unit wield are fragments of the clan’s secret arts: powerful but incomplete, dangerous to both master and user.
At his side hangs a weathered _hwando_, its blade rusted in patches yet still razor-sharp. Across his back, he carries a pair of simple **Chosun farmer’s scythes (_낫_, _nat_)** — short-handled curved sickles once used for cutting rice and reeds. In his hands, these humble tools become weapons of precise, merciless execution. He rarely draws them. When he does, it is only as a final act.
