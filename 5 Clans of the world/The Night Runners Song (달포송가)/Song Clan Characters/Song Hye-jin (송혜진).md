Song Hyejin The Silent Shade

Born into slavery under the harsh rule of Dalpo Province’s corrupt masters, the ancestor of the Night Runners Song clan endured endless chains and cruelty. Her body was bound, but her spirit remained unbroken. One day, she managed to escape and lived for years in the shadows, hidden so well that no one knew she was still alive—she had no family left. After a fateful night spent in the Ink-Root Forest, home to an unorthodox sect of assassins ten times more powerful than ordinary killers, she found by mistake a fragment of their shadow adapting technique. She adapted this technique to her own style and slowly began building a reputation as a relentless killer of inslavers and criminals. Over time, she gained followers and helpers bit by bit until she successfully created a clan, sworn to protect the oppressed from the darkness.
