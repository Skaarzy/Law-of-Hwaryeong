**Shin Gyeong-jin (신경진) – The Old Mountain**  
A towering, ruthless man of Mongol descent, Shin Gyeong-jin is the oldest elder of the Song clan and one of its most respected figures. His history is somewhat unknown, as he first arrived as a slave meant to be traded to the Song clan long ago. However, through sheer strength, discipline, and cunning, he proved himself and rose through the ranks until, in his later years, he was named an elder. Along with leading his own squad like the other elders, he also holds the rare privilege of training and recruiting new members into the clan without needing approval from the clan leader or any other elder—a clear sign of the immense trust the clan has in him.Also because of this he is the only elder who also does a job of a lieutenant as he personally trains and recruits people . 
Shin Gyeong-jin wears a **dark, heavy overcoat (durumagi)** made from thick horsehide, a relic of his Mongol roots that gives him a commanding and battle-worn presence. The coat is weathered from years of travel and training, its edges frayed but still sturdy—like the man himself.
His signature weapon is a **Hyeopdo** with its handle broken near the middle, giving it the balance and feel of a sword rather than a polearm, resembling a **Nagamaki**. Despite its damaged form, he wields it with precise, sweeping strikes that reflect both his age-honed technique and raw power.

## Shin Gyeong-jin's Training & Extraction Division:
