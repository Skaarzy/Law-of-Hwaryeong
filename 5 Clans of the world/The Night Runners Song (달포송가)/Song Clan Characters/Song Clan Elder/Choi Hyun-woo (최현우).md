**Choi Hyun-woo (최현우) – The Mongol Wolf**

One of the older elders of the Song Clan, Choi Hyun-woo descends from the original Mongols who helped the clan’s ancestor establish the organization. His expertise lies in **hunting and managing the clan’s resources**; he has little interest in the black market, holding his elder position solely to protect the people of the Song Clan. This loyalty stems from his care for the Mongol-descended members, inspired by stories his father told of times when Mongols were hunted like animals.
Tall and broad-shouldered with tanned, darker skin from his Mongol heritage, he wears **animal furs and leathers**, projecting a stern, imposing presence. He rarely shows respect except to the clan leader or a few elder friends. His weapon, a **Turk-Mongol saber**, has been passed down through generations; he maintains it meticulously, polishing and sharpening it daily. He also carries a simple bow for hunting, reflecting his role as the clan’s guardian and provider.
