**Park Sung-ho (박성호) – The Smiling Shadow**

A somewhat unhinged elder of the Song Clan, Park Sung-ho earned his position long ago by coming in second during the clan’s brutal trials. Merciless and unpredictable, he is always smiling and cracking jokes—even in the presence of the clan leader—and fears no one. He presents himself like a noble, wearing expensive clothes and jewelry and walking with the confidence of aristocracy.
But this facade serves a purpose. Once battle begins, he becomes a different person: cold, precise, and utterly emotionless. Armed with a simple jedok geom sword, he wields it with such deadly skill that his strikes land with delayed, surgical precision, leaving opponents no time to react. The combination of his cheerful demeanor and lethal efficiency has earned him the fear and respect of all who know him.
