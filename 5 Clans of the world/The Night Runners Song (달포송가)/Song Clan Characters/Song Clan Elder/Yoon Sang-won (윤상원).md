**Yoon Sang-won (윤상원) – The Shadow General**  
Unlike assassins or infiltrators, Yoon Sang-won is a true war general—responsible for guarding the province’s borders and maintaining order in the surrounding villages, whether against bandits or beasts. He stands as the living defense line of the Song clan’s territory.
A man who demands respect, Yoon Sang-won tolerates no insolence; those who fail to show it rarely live long enough to regret it. Though many elders dislike his harsh and authoritarian nature, none dare challenge him—his strength and presence alone silence any opposition.
He mastered his martial skills in the **Jeong Kingdom**, trained by royal instructors alongside other generals. Dismissed at the age of fifty due to official regulations, he found a new purpose serving the Song clan with unwavering discipline. He is the primary reason the clan still maintains strong ties with the **Jeong Dynasty**, and he now serves as the chief strategist for operations requiring large-scale planning or coordination. Though not naturally skilled in the clan’s ways, he has studied their methods extensively, blending them with Jeong military strategy to forge a unique approach to infiltration, sabotage, and control.

## Yoon Sang-won's Combat & Security Division:
- **Border Defense** - Military protection, bandit suppression, territory control
- **Bodyguard/Protection** - VIP escort, clan asset protection
- **High-Value Operation Oversight** - Sends supervisors (non-participating observers) to any mission targeting major figures (nobles, sect leaders, important merchants). These observers monitor the operation and report directly back to Yoon Sang-won, ensuring quality control and gathering intel on how missions are conducted
