**Choi Eun-ji (최은지) – Black Widow**

The former leader of the Song Clan, Choi Eun-ji, relinquished her position when she grew older, fearing she would be unable to properly teach the secret clan technique to her successor. In exchange, she demanded and was granted a seat among the elders. Despite stepping down, she still retains mastery over the secret arts and uses them when needed.
Eun-ji often serves as the clan’s envoy, traveling to other provinces to handle delicate negotiations or disputes, her presence alone a reminder of the Song Clan’s authority. Her weapon is a **folding fan** designed to conceal poison needles within each ridge. With a press of a hidden button on the handle, the needles are launched through a **spring-release mechanism**, and reloading is done by folding the fan into a special wooden case that acts as a magazine, and a hairpin that she uses for close combat.
Cold, calculating, and commanding, her words carry the weight of law. Even in silence, her presence radiates power. As a former leader, she is credited with expanding the Song Clan’s influence and evolving the black market into a far-reaching network of sub-markets spread across multiple provinces.
