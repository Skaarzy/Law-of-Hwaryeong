**Im Won-gyeong (임원경) - The Silent Shadow**
Won-gyeong is an enigma within the Song Clan—serving under Yoon Sang-won not as a traditional lieutenant, but as a bodyguard for hire. He never speaks, his face is always concealed by cloth, and his body is draped entirely in black. His arsenal reads like an assassin's dream: throwing daggers, dual swords, chain sickles (낫, nat), and an array of deadly gadgets hidden beneath his garments.
He is praised for moving like a puppet on invisible strings—emotionless, tireless, and utterly devoted to protecting whoever he is assigned to guard. Mostly deployed when important visitors arrive at the Song Clan, Won-gyeong serves as their silent escort, a living shadow that ensures no harm befalls them. The moment his task is complete, he vanishes—returning home, removing his mask, and resuming an ordinary life that no one suspects.
His real identity remains unknown. No one knows his face, his voice, or even where he lives within the province. There are whispers—unconfirmed stories—that he was once part of **the Silent Division**, though no one dares ask, and he would never answer even if they did.
Im Won-gyeong is less a person and more a ghost given form—present when needed, absent when not, and always, always silent.
