**Choi Hak-ryul (최학렬) – Jade Builder**

The son of Choi Hyun-woo, Choi Hak-ryul serves as the unit commander for **Clan Housing & Infrastructure** and **Welfare & Family Support**. Unlike most in the Song Clan, his expertise lies not in combat or espionage, but in building and maintaining the clan's infrastructure while tending to the people's basic needs.
Taught by his father from a young age, Hak-ryul mastered the intricacies of the Song Clan's settlements and systems, eventually choosing to support Hyun-woo by becoming his lieutenant. His sole focus is the welfare of the clan's people—ensuring roofs don't leak, children are fed, and families feel secure.
Stern, contemplative, and often carrying a somber demeanor, Hak-ryul refuses to compromise on matters affecting the safety or well-being of the Song Clan. He wields no weapon and has no interest in fighting, yet his unwavering dedication to the clan's foundations—both physical and social—makes him an indispensable pillar of their society.
In a clan of shadows and blades, Hak-ryul builds the home they all return to.
