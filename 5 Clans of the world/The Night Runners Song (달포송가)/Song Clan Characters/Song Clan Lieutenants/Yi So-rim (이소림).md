**Yi So-rim (이소림) – The Noble Widow**  

The main disciple and chosen successor to Choi Eun-ji, Yi So-rim was once the third-place finalist in the heir trials, narrowly escaping death when Eun-ji saved her. Since then, she has become Eun-ji’s most trusted student, learning everything from her teacher and inheriting both her cold cunning and sharp intellect.
Yi So-rim leads the **Urban Espionage and Intelligence Division**, the largest unit within the Song clan, commanding over a hundred operatives. Her leadership transformed the clan’s information network into an organized, province-spanning system. She established the **Information Hall**, a two-story archive disguised as an ordinary townhouse, filled with coded records about everything from noble scandals to military secrets. Only she and Choi Eun-ji can fully decipher its contents.
Her nickname, **“The Noble Widow,”** stems from her past—a bastard child of a noble house who was sold into slavery and later freed by the Song clan. Cold, stern, and methodical, Yi So-rim embodies the perfect balance of grace and ruthlessness, a woman whose silence carries more power than most men’s words.
