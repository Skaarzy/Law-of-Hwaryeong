**Go Sa-hun (고사훈) – The Wise Eye**

Go Sa-hun was once the elder of the Economic Operations Division, but he stepped down in favor of his disciple Lee Joon-ho, choosing instead to focus on overseeing the black market as a whole—a decision approved by the clan leader. Now, Sa-hun manages all chains of the black market, monitoring what comes in and goes out, tracking quantities and values with meticulous precision. No one else is allowed to make decisions about black market operations without his permission.
An old, pale man with a stern, harsh, and loud demeanor, Sa-hun commands respect through sheer force of personality. Known for his mastery of his personal pigeon network, Sa-hun maintains a major pigeon coupe with individual cages and a dedicated handler monitoring arrivals day and night. The birds are trained to fly to specific black market locations across provinces, delivering coded messages about trades, shipments, and item availability. This network gives Sa-hun eyes everywhere his shadow cannot reach, allowing him to control the entire underground economy with information that flows faster than any human messenger could travel.
He's often seen walking through the markets with a pigeon perched in his hands—if a question arises about inventory or pricing, he simply writes a note, releases the bird, and waits for his answer to return on wings.
In a world of whispers and secrets, Go Sa-hun's voice carries the weight of the entire underground economy.
