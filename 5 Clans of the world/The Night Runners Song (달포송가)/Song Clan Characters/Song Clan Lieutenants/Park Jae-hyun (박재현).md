**Jae-hyun (재현) - The Iron Warden**
Another former Jeong Kingdom officer released due to old age, Jae-hyun now serves as lieutenant under Yoon Sang-won, acting as his second-in-command and field representative. Unlike other lieutenants who lead small specialized units, Jae-hyun commands over a thousand soldiers who patrol and protect the Song Clan province's borders, entry points, and exit routes.
He is constantly on the move throughout the province, traveling to wherever issues arise—whether bandit raids, suspicious travelers, or border disputes. Sang-won trusts him completely and allows Jae-hyun to act as his representative when matters arise on the provincial borders. His forces also control city and village checkpoints, intercepting anyone attempting to rob, spy on, or steal information from the clan before they can penetrate deeper into Song territory.
Stern, loud, and extremely particular about how his soldiers perform their duties, Jae-hyun's uncompromising standards are exactly what Sang-won values in a commander. He wields a simple sword with the same disciplined efficiency taught in the Jeong military, having received training nearly identical to Sang-won's own.
In a clan of shadows and subtlety, Jae-hyun is the iron wall—visible, unyielding, and impossible to bypass.
