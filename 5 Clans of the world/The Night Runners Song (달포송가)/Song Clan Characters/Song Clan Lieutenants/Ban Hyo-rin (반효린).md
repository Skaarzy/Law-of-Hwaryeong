**Ban Hyo-rin (반효린) – The Huntress**  
The second unit under Choi Eun-ji’s command is led by Ban Hyo-rin, who oversees **Rural and Inter-Provincial Intelligence**. Her division manages all information related to geography, trade routes, and large population centers, as well as the creation of precise, coded maps for the clan’s operations across provinces.
Born into a Song clan family, Ban Hyo-rin grew up alongside **Yi So-rim**, who later introduced her to Choi Eun-ji. Recognizing her potential, Eun-ji took her under her wing, and Hyo-rin quickly proved herself nearly as capable as So-rim—sharp, resourceful, and fearless.
Unlike the composed and cold nature of her peers, Ban Hyo-rin is wild-spirited and independent, doing what she wants and caring little for how others perceive her. She’s often seen with her **pet wolf**, a creature she tamed as a child and trained to obey her every command. Together, they move like predators through the shadows, silent and untamed—a reflection of Hyo-rin herself.
