**Kim Yoon-bok (김윤복) - The Sword Ghost**
Just as cold and unemotional as the elder who took him in, Yoon-bok usually wears a blank or faintly angry expression that makes him as feared as Shin Gyeong-jin himself. He is the only Lieutenant under Shin Gyeong-jin, and his role is singular: **Interrogation and Extraction**—breaking prisoners and extracting information from anyone he is commanded to question.
Yoon-bok is usually found in the Song Clan's prisons, where he even maintains his own living quarters. He rarely ventures into the city unless summoned, not because he's ordered to stay, but because the isolation suits him. An extreme introvert, he dislikes human contact and finds comfort in the cold stone walls and silence of the cells.
Countless rumors surround him and his methods of obtaining information—whispers of techniques so brutal and precise they blur the line between torture and art. His nickname, **The Sword Ghost**, speaks to his ability to cut through a person's will as cleanly as a blade through flesh.
Yoon-bok's origins are unusual: he was gifted to the Song Clan leader as a child by a slave trader. The clan leader personally trained him until the age of fifteen, making him one of the few outside the leadership who knows techniques reserved only for the matriarch herself. This rare knowledge, combined with his chilling demeanor, makes Kim Yoon-bok a living nightmare in the depths of the clan's dungeons..
