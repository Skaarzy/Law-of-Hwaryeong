**Yoon Baek-jo (윤백조) - Shadow of Chaos**
Yoon Baek-jo is a master at his craft and a close friend of Park Sung-ho, having grown up together causing mischief and mayhem throughout their childhood. From a Mongol family with Joseon blood through his mother's side, Baek-jo is a tall, bulky young man who now serves as Lieutenant of **Frame Jobs & False Flag Operations** and **Forgery & Documentation**.
His most distinctive feature is his pet eagle, trained for years to track, hunt, and even steal when necessary. Baek-jo communicates with the bird through whistles, calls, and hand gestures, making them an inseparable team. His unit is almost constantly deployed on missions, rarely spending time in the Song Clan's main city—so when he does return, it's celebrated with a grand banquet.
His personality mirrors Sung-ho's outgoing, extroverted, and unpredictable nature, but with a key difference: Baek-jo is intensely serious and guarded when meeting someone for the first time, often appearing to look down on them. It's not arrogance—it's deep-seated distrust. He rarely extends his confidence to strangers until they've proven themselves worthy of it.
In a clan built on deception, Baek-jo embodies chaos wrapped in suspicion—a dangerous combination.
