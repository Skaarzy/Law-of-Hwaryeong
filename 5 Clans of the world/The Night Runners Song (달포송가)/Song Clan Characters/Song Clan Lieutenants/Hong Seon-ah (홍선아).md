**Hong Seon-ah (홍선아) - The Ink Phantom**
The main lieutenant for **Forgery & Documentation** under Park Sung-ho's Sabotage & Deception Division, Hong Seon-ah is unmatched in creating false identities, counterfeit documents, seal replications, and fabricated evidence. She lived on the streets of the Song Clan's territory for years until Park Sung-ho discovered her by accident and recognized her sharp spirit. He took her in and taught her everything about the clan's operations in forgery and documentation.
Now an expert in her craft, only Seon-ah can issue and create documents so realistic they open any door—be it a noble's estate or a royal archive. Smart and witty, she possesses intimate knowledge of the Song Clan's streets, those dark and gloomy places most avoid. She is usually found working nonstop in her office, surrounded by ink, seals, and half-finished forgeries.
Though she has knowledge and skill in fighting, she rarely uses it—having never left the Song Clan's province, her battlefield is paper, and her weapon is the brush.
