Nam Gyu-taek (남규택) - The Deadly Healer
Nam Gyu-taek placed fifth in the heir contest—not for lack of talent, but because his strength lies not in combat, but in **healing and subtle manipulation**, using herbs and potions to weaken enemies until they destroy themselves. His mastery of medicine and alchemy earned him the mentorship of Choi Hyun-woo. He is missing one eye, a reminder of the dangers he faced during the heir trials.
Always neutral in demeanor, it’s impossible for others to discern what he’s thinking. Gyu-taek lives alone in a hut near the woods, tending a meticulous garden where he grows ingredients and prepares potions. For healing, he travels from home to home when needed, and also runs a **clinic in the main city**, treating everyone from battle-wounded clan members to victims of poisoning. His quiet, solitary life hides a mind as precise and deadly as the remedies he crafts.
