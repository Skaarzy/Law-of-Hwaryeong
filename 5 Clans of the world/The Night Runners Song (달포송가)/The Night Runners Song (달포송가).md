**Overview**

The Song Clan is a shadow-bound bloodline that thrives in the night-shrouded streets and hidden harbors of Dalpo Province. Mostly led by women, they are the unseen hand behind the province’s black market, smuggling operations, and secret intelligence networks. Their influence stretches far beyond the borders of Dalpo, yet it is nearly impossible to trace. Masters of stealth and subterfuge, every member of the Song Clan is trained from birth in the Silent Veil Arts, a combination of deadly poison knowledge, expert lockpicking, silent assassination, and unparalleled evasion. They move like ghosts, striking swiftly and vanishing before their enemies can react.
The clan traces its origins to a notorious master thief who, centuries ago, stole the Royal jade seal right under the palace guards’ noses. The Mongol refugees helped the Song Clan’s ancestor hide after she stole the jade seal and establish the clan, sharing their knowledge of poisons and shamanic practices. Over generations, the clan became a mix of Mongol and Joseon bloodlines, living, training, and surviving together, creating the unique, deadly society known today .This legendary act cemented their place in the underworld and marked the beginning of their rise as rulers of Dalpo’s shadow economy. Despite their covert nature, the Song Clan maintains near-monopolies on intelligence and espionage across multiple provinces, making them indispensable to powerful sects and nobles. Their network of spies and informants is rumored to even reach into the Royal court. Unlike other clans that openly claim land or military power, the Songs’ strength lies in secrecy itself. Rivals who attempt to eliminate them often fail—or end up becoming victims themselves.
Generations ago, a Song ancestor infiltrated the Shadow-Ink Assassins and stole fragments of their shadow cultivation manual before escaping into the night. This incomplete technique allows clan leaders to slip into existing shadows and move within darkness, though they cannot create or control shadows as the original masters could. They remain bound to whatever darkness already exists, making them formidable in dim alleys but nearly helpless under the noon sun.
The Song Clan differs from most other clans in that family lineage is largely irrelevant. Their secret techniques are not inherited through blood but learned through rigorous practice and cultivation. Heirs are chosen based on skill and potential rather than heritage. Selection begins at a young age, typically between seven and nine. Children, often beggars or orphans that are qi sensitive but don't know it ,with nowhere else to turn, are offered the opportunity to join the clan. Most accept. The first stage of the trial takes place underground in a cave, where twenty children must survive for a year under harsh conditions with limited supplies. They are given cruel and often unfair tasks, and in this environment, they may do whatever is necessary to survive, even kill.
When only about six children remain, they move to the next stage, where each becomes a team leader and assembles their own group of peers. These six leaders now face real missions—espionage, sabotage, and intelligence-gathering. Failure is not tolerated; capture or exposure means death. Over the next six months, the children’s adaptability, resourcefulness, and reputation are tested under real-world conditions. At the end of this period, the clan evaluates the remaining candidates, taking into account elder support and performance. A single child is chosen as the next heir—sometimes earlier if only one survives.
The chosen heir then enters seclusion to study the internal workings of the clan under direct instruction from the clan leader, learning the clan’s secret techniques. This training period lasts up to six years. Upon completion, the heir returns to active duty, undertaking missions of higher importance, often alongside the clan leader. During this stage, the heir continues refining their skills while gaining experience in leadership and the management of covert operations.
The general hierarchy of the Song Clan mirrors this structure. While the clan leader holds absolute authority, the elders function as semi-independent commanders. Each elder maintains a personally selected team or unit under their direct command. Unlike in other clans, where elders may hold voting power or influence over leadership decisions, Song Clan elders are limited to commanding their own forces and cannot overrule the leader.
Each elder’s organization differs in purpose and composition, yet they all share a consistent chain of command: an elder oversees multiple lieutenants, and each lieutenant leads their own squad or sub-unit. Orders flow downward—elders issue directives to their lieutenants, who then mobilize their squads to execute the mission. In certain cases, an elder may assemble only their lieutenants into a specialized operations team for tasks requiring precision or secrecy.
The Song Clan is ruthless, secretive, and unmatched in its mastery of shadow and stealth. Its members move unseen, strike decisively, and vanish without a trace. Survival, skill, and cunning—not blood—define who rises to lead, making the Song Clan a force that controls Dalpo Province’s underworld with a quiet but iron grip.The structure of the clan is somewhat basic but its worked for them for decades :

**Why They Remain in Power**
- **Control of Secrets:** Their vast network of spies, informants, and assassins ensures they know every whisper of rebellion or conspiracy.
- **Black Market Monopoly:** They control smuggling routes and forbidden goods, making them essential partners even for lawful powers.
- **Shadow Alliances:** The Song Clan trades information and favors with sects and nobles, ensuring mutual benefits and protection.
- **Mastery of Poisons:** Their knowledge of rare toxins allows them to remove threats discreetly and without bloodshed that draws attention.
**Player Role and Experience**
Choosing the Song Clan allows the player to step into the world of shadow warfare. The player can develop skills in silent movement, lock picking, assassination, and poison crafting. The path includes dangerous missions behind enemy lines, espionage, and making morally gray choices to manipulate power without ever showing their face.
Players who choose this clan can later decide whether to remain loyal to their bloodline’s shadowy codes or to defect and join a sect for more overt power and training — opening unique story-lines of betrayal, loyalty, and identity.To leave the Clan one can just decide to run away and keep hiding even though this clan is notorious for finding people and assassinating them when they least expect or earn the clans trust and become a inner disciple which are allowed to go out of the clan and join other organisations like sect or the Jeong Dynasty but u must keep informing on the organisation u decide to join(these would be side-quest of no importance if they are failed unless u fail more than 10 then another inner disciple can appear randomly and attack u as a warning)
