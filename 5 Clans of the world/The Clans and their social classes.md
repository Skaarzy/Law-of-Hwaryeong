All of the clan families can use a specific qi technique which they got from various ways but 
none of those techniques are able to be cultivated meaning like normal sect ones which one can cultivate and build over time to become a eternal instead they are more of a bloodline qi which only those who have the clan founders blood can use that qi and there are those special ones which can excel in using that special qi but even they can unlock their meridians or reach even a single stage breakthrough nobody knows how these qi abilities came to be but one thing is certain that those who wield them are on the same level of the grand-masters of some sects

## **Clan Social Hierarchy (Bloodline Qi-Based)**
**Top Class: Main Family / Clan Founder Bloodline (“Royalty”)**
- **Definition**: Descendants of the original clan founder; only they can wield the clan’s bloodline qi fully.
- **Role**: Leadership of the clan; make all major decisions.
- **Positioning**:
    - Clan leader = most powerful child of previous leader.
    - Succession for multiple children = determined by **bloodline qi strength / personal power**.
- **Lifestyle**: Luxurious, respected, all privileges; unmatched cultivation potential within the clan.

**Second Class: Side Families / Noble Branches**
- **Definition**: Descendants of other branches of the clan; not direct founder bloodline.
- **Role**: Respected members of the clan; enjoy comfort and security.
- **Limitations**: No power in major decisions; live separately from main house; some wealth but less than main family.
- **Lifestyle**: Noble-class treatment but subordinate to main family.

**Third Class: Commoners / Warriors**
- **Definition**: Ordinary members of the clan who aren’t related to the founder or side families. Includes warriors and regular working clan members.
- **Role**:
    - **Warriors**: Protect the clan, perform dangerous or “unclean” tasks, train to defend clan lands.
    - **Commoners**: Handle jobs necessary for the clan’s survival (farming, crafting, logistics, minor labor).
- **Lifestyle**: Simple lives; some perform unclean jobs but all for the clan’s benefit.
- **Mobility**: Rare; could earn respect through deeds but never ascend into main or side family ranks.

**Fourth Class: Slaves**
- **Definition**: Owned only by the main family; can be gifted to side families.
- **Role**: Laborers for main or side families; no rights in clan politics.
