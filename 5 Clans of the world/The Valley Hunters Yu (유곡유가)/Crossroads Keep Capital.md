Crossroads Keep Capital of Valley Hunters Yu (Yugok Province)

A bustling a part grassland part mountain side town where multiple dirt roads converge before heading through thick forests and mountain passes. Highly humid almost jungle like atmosphere Built into terraced levels following the mountainside which are covered in moss and grass, with most buildings made out of wooden Korean-style buildings overlooking lush green valleys below. It might look like a poor and on the bring of collapse, but its quite the opposite as the outside of buildings is rough and damaged as the nature around the village isn't forgiving because of the pressure and the humidity the wood easily weakens, but on the inside those houses are almost like those in the capital as its a neatly design with there being :
- **Maru (마루)** - Raised wooden flooring systems that allowed air to circulate underneath the house, preventing moisture buildup and keeping floors dry
- **Daecheong (대청)** - Large open wooden-floored central halls that served as the main living space during hot, humid months - completely open to allow maximum airflow
- **Strategic eave design** - Extended rooflines that provided shade while allowing air circulation around the building's perimeter
- **Cross-ventilation planning** - Doors and windows positioned to create natural airflow corridors through buildings
- **Courtyard layouts** - Traditional Korean homes built around central courtyards that created cooling air currents and natural temperature regulation
- **Elevated construction** - Many buildings raised on stone foundations with air gaps underneath
- **Hanji (한지) paper windows** - Traditional Korean paper was semi-permeable, allowing some air exchange while maintaining privacy
- **Wooden construction over stone** - Wood naturally breathes and doesn't retain moisture like stone masonry
- **Clay and earth walls** - These materials naturally regulate humidity by absorbing and releasing moisture
All this made the living in this place much easier and also the people get used to the humidity and heat , the where couple of districts of the city:
- **The Great Stables District:** Massive horse complexes where the Yu breed their famous mounts which is located on the hillsides.

- **Lakeside District:** A big harbor like place where the houses are raised on stilts .The lake rises easily the mountain rain water and river go into it, its important because of its drinkable water

- **Lake Merchant post:** As well on the lake but used for trading and transports via boats and small ships used for bulk trade.

- **Market road:** Similar to the lake merchant post , but the main difference being its used as a main market for everybody , its located on the main road and a part of the center of the town as well

- **Main Capital:** Its more of a building complex than a district its made out of 5 buildings mmain palace and other houses used to maintain the palace, the palace is made out of wood and stone and its 4 floors high

- **Hunting District:** Located on the outer parts of the city but has a part inside it as well near the capital as the clan also has a Hunters' Society has its own district which is isolated by walls as they are considered the nobles of the Yu clan.

- **Caravan Rest District:** Large courtyards and inns designed for merchant wagon trains which is located on the outer part of the city near the forest and main road
- 
- **The Trading Posts District:** Multi-story wooden buildings stocked with travel supplies,located all around the main city but the biggest one is directly in the center of the town a big 3 floor wooden house.
- 
- **The Archery Ranges District:** Training grounds built into the mountainside terraces,made for only experienced warriors to train in.
- 
- **Forest Gate Checkpoints:** Where the Yu collect their "protection fees" from merchants this is located all around the province but the main hub is in this main city where all of the money goes and information is gathered of who goes and who comes

The sound of hooves on stone echoes constantly. Trading posts and inns line every road, ready to supply merchant caravans. Wooden bridges span rushing mountain streams, and everything thrives - thick forests, rich farming valleys, prosperous trade. The Yu live well here, their mounted archers patrolling the roads that bring them wealth and power.
