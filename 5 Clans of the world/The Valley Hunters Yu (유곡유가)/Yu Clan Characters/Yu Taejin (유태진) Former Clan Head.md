 V **Name:** Yu Taejin (유태진)  
**Title:** _The Iron Wolf_

**Background:**  
Yu Taejin ruled the Yu Clan for thirty-seven years with an iron fist that never wavered, never showed mercy, and never bent to pressure from Jeong Dynasty or enemy alike. His reputation was built on absolute discipline - he executed deserters, banished the lazy, and demanded perfection from every warrior under his command. Yet under his harsh rule, the Yu Clan reached heights of prosperity and respect they had never known before or since. Trade routes flourished under his protection, merchant caravans paid premium rates for Yu escorts, and even the Royal court acknowledged the clan's dominance over the valley passages.
His weapon of choice was a simple Hwando sword - nothing ornate, no special materials, just perfectly balanced steel that became legendary through his mastery. Taejin's swordsmanship was so refined that sect masters would travel great distances just to witness his technique. He could cut falling leaves into perfect spirals, slice through armor without disturbing the cloth beneath, and his single blade work was said to rival entire sword formations. His Wild Qi was unlike any other Yu clansman - instead of the wild, barely controlled fury that characterized their bloodline, Taejin had achieved perfect mastery over his ancestral power. He could release it in hair-thin streams to enhance his reflexes for delicate cuts, or unleash torrents of raw energy that shattered stone and steel alike. Most remarkably, his Wild Qi never consumed his humanity - where others became savage beasts, Taejin remained coldly calculating and perfectly controlled even at full power.
But the very control that made him invincible also became his downfall. The constant strain of containing and directing such immense power began wearing down his body from within. His heart, forced to pump blood enhanced with Wild Qi for decades, gradually weakened. In his final years, the man who had once commanded absolute respect became a frail shadow - his once-powerful frame withered to skin and bone, his legendary strength reduced to trembling hands that could barely hold his beloved sword. He spent his last two years confined to his chambers, a hollow shell of the terrifying leader who had shaped the Yu Clan's golden age, finally succumbing when his exhausted heart simply stopped beating one winter morning.
