**Background:**  
Jung Dong-su represents a new generation of Yu Clan leadership, having been groomed from childhood by the previous lake region elder who died peacefully of old age. His mentor saw potential in the young boy and spent decades teaching him not just the practical aspects of water management and trade oversight, but the deeper philosophy of how the clan operates and thrives. At mid-30s, Dongsu is unusually young for an elder position, leading some to question his readiness for such responsibility. However, his innovative approach to water management silenced most critics - his canal system designs have revolutionized how water moves through Yu territory, improving both irrigation and transportation efficiency. His close relationship with Clan Head Yu Gon often raises eyebrows, as the two are frequently seen together on expeditions and social gatherings, more like brothers than superior and subordinate. His appearance reflects this casual relationship - long black hair, well-maintained black beard, and his distinctive fox hide draped over soldier-like armor that's been modified with cloth for comfort and flexibility. His weapons training came directly from Yu Gon, making him one of the few non-family members to learn the clan head's personal techniques. His extroverted nature and quick decision-making style sometimes seem reckless to older clan members, but his results speak for themselves - the lake and river region has become one of the most prosperous and strategically important territories under Yu control.
