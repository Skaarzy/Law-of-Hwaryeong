**Background:**  
Gang Myeong-ho has governed the Main Forest Region for over four decades, transforming from a wandering herbalist who came from the [[Heavenly Root Sect]] as a child to explore and make documentation on what herbs and plants grow there. What started as a research expedition became a lifelong commitment when she discovered the forest's hidden potential and chose to remain. Her impossibly preserved health at 90+ years comes from decades of consuming the Heavenly Root Sect's longevity potions combined with her own forest remedies - she moves somewhat slower than in her prime but shows no signs of getting tired, weakening, or giving up her duties. Her tall, wiry frame is draped in countless layers of animal hide clothing adorned with multiple leather pouches, each pocket containing different herbs, toxins, antidotes, or brewing supplies meticulously organized by color and scent. The massive wicker-wrapped bottle she carries contains her personal liquor blend - a potent rice wine infused with rare forest herbs that she claims "keeps the bones strong and the mind sharp."
Her mastery over the forest is absolute, having lived there since before she can remember forming clear memories. She knows every tree, stream, animal path, and seasonal change within her vast territory, treating the entire region like an extension of her own body. Under her guidance, farmers plant crops in seemingly random locations that somehow yield incredible harvests, while her strategic placement of medicinal herb gardens has created a thriving pharmaceutical trade that benefits the entire Yu Clan. Her expertise in poison-making follows strict clan guidelines - she can only brew non-lethal toxins or ones that cause temporary paralysis, as the clan forbids the killing of animals through improper methods. She is renowned for her precision needles and arrows that can stop a charging bear mid-charge or put an entire bandit camp into peaceful sleep without causing permanent harm.
Her personality is uniquely contradictory - she complains constantly about people talking too much and disrupting her important work, yet she doesn't actually care what they're saying and will often continue her botanical tasks while half-listening to their chatter. She's neither warm nor cold, simply pragmatically detached, treating most social interactions as minor inconveniences to be endured rather than genuine moments of human connection. Despite her perpetual grumbling demeanor and her origins from an outside sect, her loyalty to the Yu Clan has become absolute over the decades, and her innovative forest management has made their territory more prosperous, sustainable, and defensible than ever before.
