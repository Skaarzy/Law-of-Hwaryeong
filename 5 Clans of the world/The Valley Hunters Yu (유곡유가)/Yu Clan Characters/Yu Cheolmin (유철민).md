**Background:**  
Yu Cheolmin is a second generation Yu family and was the youngest, and was a third strongest in the competition for the patriarchy position,he was praised for his skills in tactics, creativity and tracking but still he was unable to become the patriarchy,so he earned his title not just for his legendary marksmanship, but for his bond with **Baeh**, a golden eagle he rescued as a chick and trained through a complex system of wing gestures, talon taps, and flight patterns that only he can decipher. The eagle scouts enemy positions, counts numbers, identifies weaknesses, and reports back through their private code — information that has saved countless Yu warriors from ambushes. Cheolmin is mercilessly harsh with newcomers and strangers, his cold demeanor cutting through pleasantries like winter wind, but those who earn his trust see a different man — still stern and exacting, but genuinely caring about their improvement. He constantly corrects warriors' stances and techniques, believing that sloppy form gets people killed and dishonors the clan's reputation. His lean, wiry frame is wrapped in simple beast hide with a leather holster of throwing whip hanging on his other hip ready to be used by. **"Sharp-piercer"** hangs at his hip alongside a quiver of custom arrows — lighter than standard with shorter, razor-sharp eagle-claw tips that punch through armor gaps with surgical precision. His **"Eagle Whip"** long leather whip is balanced for control  of enemies that are to close to kill with the bow, each whip lash capable of finding weak spots in armor and its also used to disarm enemies. When enemies close distance, he draws **"Swift Fang"**, a deceptively light Dan Jangchang spear that moves like liquid lightning in his hands bending and following his hand like wind. Unlike Hamcheol's overwhelming power, Cheolmin fights with calculated patience — studying and stalking his target, waiting for the perfect moment, then striking once with lethal precision. His philosophy is simple: if you need a second shot, you've already failed. Cheolmins Wild Qi awakened quite late but still the result way unique his Wild Qi is that of a unique talent to control birds, and to see what they see but only those birds that are tamed is he able to use hi Wild Qi on if its a wild bird it just dies as the Qi is too much for it to handle,the Qi must be delivered to the bird in small microdoses so it can get used to it. Also once he uses his Qi he goes into a trance making him extremely vulnerable.
