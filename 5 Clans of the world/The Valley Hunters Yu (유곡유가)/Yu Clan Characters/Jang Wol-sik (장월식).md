**Background:**  
Jang Wol-sik's path to eldership began as an thorn in the side of the Yu Clan. For years, he operated sophisticated smuggling networks through secret routes in the eastern forests that even the clan's expert trackers had never discovered. His downfall came by pure accident - a routine Yu hunting party stumbled across one of his operations, leading to his capture and imprisonment. During his incarceration, something unexpected happened: Jang Wol-sik genuinely reformed. Perhaps it was the clan's treatment of prisoners, or simply the realization that his criminal life had no real future, but he made a complete transformation. To prove his sincerity, he revealed every secret path, hidden cache, and smuggling contact he knew, essentially destroying his own criminal Jeong Dynasty to gain the clan's trust. His information opened up entirely new trade possibilities in the eastern region, creating routes that dramatically improved commerce flow. The Yu Clan accepted his offer of service, but under strict conditions: he cannot leave his assigned village, cannot contact anyone from other provinces, and is permanently forbidden from learning any martial arts or hunting techniques. His simple appearance - dark beard, long tied hair, and plain villager clothes - reflects his acceptance of this humble new life. Despite these restrictions, his extroverted personality and love of jokes and drinking make him popular with locals. His sharp trading mind and extensive knowledge of commercial networks have made the eastern region more profitable than ever, though some still question whether a former criminal can truly be trusted with such responsibility none can complain as he was put there by the former clan leader.
