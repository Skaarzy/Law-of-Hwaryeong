**Background:**  
Yu Hamcheol has served two clan heads in his lifetime, fulfilling the role of being a master to them while they were younger by teaching them pure tactical brilliance and unshakeable strength. He lost his left eye defending a child from a rabid bear, but the scar only added to his fearsome reputation as that rabid bear had a legend of its own. Other clan leaders seek his counsel in matters of war and hunting expeditions— a rare honor for any Yu clansman. He raised most of the current lineage heirs, teaching them that strength without wisdom is just violence, and silence without purpose is just emptiness. His word carries weight even with Yu Gon, who still calls him "Master" in private moments. His appearance is deliberately disheveled as he doesn't care about it — pristine animal skin hides worn like a hermit's rags, his massive frame moving with a hunter's silence that unnerves enemies. He has a long messy grey-streaked beard and missing left eye with a major scar across it. His build is that of a bear with his whole body being large but still somewhat fit with a muscle belly like a weightlifter, yet his steps are silent and his body moves light as he is deceptively fast. His main weapon called **"Ironbark Cleaver"** is wielded not with finesse but pure devastating force — swinging it in massive arcing chops that treat armored enemies like trees to be felled, the blade's curve allowing him to hook and tear through shields before splitting the man behind them. His overhead strikes can cleave clean through horse and rider in one terrible swing. His second weapon is **"Treesplitter"** a war longbow so heavy that most men can't even draw it — Hamcheol pulls it to his ear with casual ease, launching arrows with such force they punch through trees and multiple armored targets in a single shot. Respectfully formal when talking but economical with words, he speaks only when necessary, but when he does, its a clear and almost commanding sound which draws everyone's attention. Calm as still water until battle begins, then becomes an unstoppable force of calculated destruction.His Wild Qi awakened a brute power of the Yu clans ancestors, once he releases it his eyes become to glow bright yellow and his killing intent gets so high it suffocates plats around him, with his brutal yet fast attack being impossible to block or dodge he is the example of how strong the Yu clan Wild Qi can be.
