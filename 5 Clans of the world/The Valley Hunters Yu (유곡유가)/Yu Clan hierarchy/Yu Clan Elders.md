The Yu clan's elder system operates differently from traditional clan structures. Unlike most clans where elders come from the main bloodline and hold significant decision-making power, Yu elders are predominantly drawn from branch families and allied bloodlines, serving primarily as regional administrators rather than policy makers. However, their importance to the clan cannot be understated - they form the backbone of Yu territorial control and defense.
The Yu province is divided into three distinct regions, each governed by a trusted elder who maintains absolute authority over their territory. These elder-governors manage local trade routes, oversee resource allocation, settle disputes between villages, and coordinate defense against bandits and external threats. Their intimate knowledge of the land and its people makes them invaluable assets to the clan's prosperity and security.
Originally, there were four regions under elder governance. The fourth territory was stripped away following a devastating betrayal - one elder secretly provided crucial trade route information to bandit groups, resulting in multiple caravan massacres and significant financial losses. When the then Clan Head Yu Taejin (유태진) uncovered the treachery through his intelligence network, swift justice followed. The traitor was publicly executed, his severed head displayed on a spike at the valley's main entrance as a warning to others. By Taejin's direct order, the elder's name was struck from all clan records, and speaking it became forbidden - ensuring his legacy would be one of nameless shame rather than remembered infamy.
