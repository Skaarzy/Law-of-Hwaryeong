### **The Rise of the Kingdom and the Orthodox Sects**
Before the Orthodox sects rose, the continent was **fragmented and chaotic** — small martial clans, wandering warriors, minor city-states, and tribal groups competing for land and influence non stop.No unified authority each clan or small tribe governed its own territory.Martial culture was developing techniques, schools, and philosophies existed but were isolated. The frequent conflict skirmishes and local wars were common; only the strongest or smartest survived. Early alliances and rivalries began forming loose coalitions, which later evolved into the Orthodox sects.
In **1128**, most martial clans either **merged or were absorbed** by stronger groups, forming the **Orthodox sects**. These newly united sects became the **continent’s ruling force**, establishing territory, law, and martial order that would dominate for the next 200+ years leading up to 1331.  
Those that didn’t agree to merge went into **hiding**, fearing the power of the now-dominant Orthodox sects.
From the begging and the creation of the Orthodox sects there where always Alliances & Rivalries between the sects , but there is still a hierarchy inbetween them, the main and oldest 5 which where created from the oldest martial clans ,where the ones which created most laws and rules and are still regarded as the strongest and those are :
[[Plum Blossom Sect]] , [[Heavenly Sword Sect]] , [[Jade Orchid Sect]], [[Frost Moon Sect (서월파)]] and [[Divine Seal Sect]].The other 5 where created later but have gained decedent amount of power and those are : [[Beggars Sect]], [[Celestial Gate Sect]], [[Divine Thunder Hall]], [[Serene Mountain Sect]], [[Wind Cloud Pavilion]].
The **Orthodox sects** were the peak of power on the continent, considered the world’s order. They controlled most of the land, set the laws, and dictated martial and social norms. Even after decades, their authority remained unchallenged, though new factions emerged, including unorthodox sects and the **Kingdom of Jeong**. None were strong enough to threaten the Orthodox sects’ supremacy.
Because of their beliefs and confidence, the sects allowed the kingdom to flourish, while keeping unorthodox sects small and weak — respected by commoners but politically harmless. The kingdom, at that time part of a foreign empire, acted as a liaison between the empire and the sects, stabilizing the region.
Over time, the foreign empire revealed its true ambition: full conquest of the continent. Threatened by this, the kingdom negotiated a new deal with the Orthodox sects: in exchange for helping the kingdom gain independence, the kingdom would provide the sects with ship plans and trade routes, preventing the empire from accessing the continent. The sects agreed, securing their power and maintaining the continent’s stability. The kingdom became fully independent, and the empire abandoned its plans to conquer the region.

### **Scenario: Kingdom Emerging from the Empire**
1. **Initial Status:**
    - The kingdom was under foreign imperial rule.
    - Orthodox sects dominated the continent politically, socially, and militarily.

2. **Kingdom’s Early Role:**
    - Acted as a liaison between the empire and the sects.
    - Maintained some autonomy, allowed by sects to stabilize the region and control unorthodox sects.

3. **Empire’s Expansion:**
    - The empire eventually sought full control of the continent, threatening both kingdom and sects.

4. **New Alliance & Independence:**
    - Kingdom negotiated independence with sect support, offering strategic resources (maps, trade routes) in return.
    - Orthodox sects accepted, securing their influence and neutralizing the empire’s threat.

5. **Resulting Status:**
    - The kingdom became independent.
    - Orthodox sects remained dominant, with the kingdom as an ally.
    - The foreign empire retreated.

### **Social Classes of the Orthodox Sects**

**Top Layer: Cultivators (Yangban equivalent)**
- Innate ability to cultivate qi (strong veins, aura, prodigious talent).
- Leaders, elite warriors, and famous prodigies.
- Birth family matters less; talent is decisive.

**Middle Layer: Warrior/Protector Class**
- Moderate talent disciples, performing essential sect duties.
- Carry out “unclean” jobs (slaughtering beasts, cleaning battlefields, enforcement).
- Includes kingdom-trained specialists (doctors, strategists, craftsmen).

**Commoners / Non-specialists**
- Farmers, artisans, merchants supplying food, materials, and services to the sect.

**Low-born / Unfit for Cultivation (Unclean equivalent)**
- Those without qi potential or severely disabled.
- Perform minor labor or are supported by the sect.
- Socially marginalized but treated better than historical Joseon cheonmin.

---
### **Treatment of Low-born but Powerful Cultivators**
- **Publicly:** Sect warriors are respected regardless of origin; nobles do not openly belittle them because sect strength surpasses the kingdom. Sect affiliation defines status.
- **Privately:** Nobles may still judge low-born cultivators in whispers or behind closed doors, maintaining pride in bloodline.
- **Result:** A double standard exists — public respect, private resentment. Sect prestige dominates in practice, but old noble arrogance lingers in the shadows.
