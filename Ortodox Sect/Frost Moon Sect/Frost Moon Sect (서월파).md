**Sect Master:** [[Yoon Jin (윤진)- The Phantom Blade]]]  
**Location:** [[The Frozen Meridian Peaks]]

**Hangul:** 서월파 (_Seo-wol-pa_)  
**Hanja:** 霜月派 – _霜_ (Seo) = Frost / _月_ (Wol) = Moon / _派_ (Pa) = Sect

The **Frost Moon Sect (서월파)** is a disciplined, cerebral order devoted to the mastery of qi through **mental focus, calmness, and stillness**. Its name reflects both the **serene, icy peaks that serve as its home** and the **graceful precision of its techniques**.
When a disciple manipulates qi to control blades, their movements from afar resemble a **raging blizzard**, yet up close they flow like **falling snow petals**—perfectly measured and serene. This duality embodies the sect’s philosophy: **true mastery lies in absolute control, serenity, and elegance amid chaos**.
The sect’s mountain home was chosen deliberately. The cold environment tempers emotion and trains disciples to cultivate **pure, refined qi**. While their techniques do not draw on ice itself, the harsh climate strengthens both mental discipline and spiritual focus, sharpening their qi far beyond that of ordinary warriors.
After the **Demon War**, Sect Master **Yoon Jin** transformed the Frost Moon Sect from a martial order into a **school of philosophy and qi cultivation**, reflecting his own path after injury. Yet, specialized divisions remained—**warrior branches** dedicated to preserving and passing down the sect’s unique martial techniques.
Today, the Frost Moon Sect endures not only as a bastion of power but as a **sanctuary of knowledge**, revered throughout the lands as **teachers of both combat and the mind**..
### **Sect Philosophy & Style**
**Reasoning for Control:**  
Disciples are trained to remain **calm, composed, and mentally still**. Emotional or hasty actions disrupt qi flow and precision, so **mental discipline is paramount**.

**Technique Style:**
- Telekinetic blade manipulation (formerly “Grasping Will”)
- Movements appear chaotic to outsiders but are meticulously controlled
- Techniques evoke **blizzards and falling snow petals**, symbolizing both destructive potential and graceful precision
