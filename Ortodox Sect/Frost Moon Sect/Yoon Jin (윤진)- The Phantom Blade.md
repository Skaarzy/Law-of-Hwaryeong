Once known as the **“Master of Qi”** and the strongest warrior of the **Frost Moon Sect (서월파)**, **Yoon Jin** was a living legend. A genius in swordsmanship, he wielded his blade in ways no one else could—blending instinct, precision, and qi into one seamless art.
During the **Eternal War**, while defending the mountain, he was struck by a demonic technique from one of the **Eight Demon Generals**, leaving him **paralyzed from the waist down**.
After his injury, Yoon Jin **turned his focus inward**, devoting himself entirely to the study of qi. From this came the **Frost Moon: Qi-Control Blade Techniques**—a discipline that allowed the sword to be guided purely through qi. Though he could no longer wield a weapon himself, he perfected the theory and passed it down to his disciples, who carried his teachings across the land.
His **qi sensitivity was unparalleled**: he could sense the energy of others from miles away, perceive the flow of attacks, and predict an opponent’s next move as if reading their thoughts. While most scholars merely speculated about qi, Yoon Jin sought to **push its very boundaries**.
He trained in brutal conditions—often seen shirtless in the snow, cultivating his qi as the freezing air met the heat radiating from his body. Through relentless discipline, he achieved what no one had before: **direct manipulation of qi within his own body**.
In time, he went even further, creating a secret art known only to him—**Qi Manipulation**. This technique allowed him to control the qi of others with his own, a feat requiring such precision and mastery that few could even comprehend it. With it, Yoon Jin could **halt an opponent’s flow of qi**, or **turn their own energy against them** some say he can even hold others qi in his hand , making him appear vulnerable while wielding power equal to that of a **transcendent being**
Yoon Jin’s philosophy is remembered through his maxim:  
**“To control the blade, one must first control the mind.”**  
It became the cornerstone of the Frost Moon Sect’s teachings, symbolizing mastery of the mind and spirit over mere technique.
Despite his physical limitations, Yoon Jin played a **decisive role in the Demon War**, defending Frost Moon Province and halting the demonic advance. His legacy endures as that of a **strategist, a scholar, and a legend who transcended the body to master the spirit.**
