It was created after the demon war to honor those who fought the demons and protected the Jeong Dynasty. This House and all of its residence and property was destroyed when the commoners raided it after Dong Tak started the rebellion against the Jeong Dynasty
[[Ju Wi-guk (주위국) - The Calm Commander]]

### **The Compound**
The House of Iron Merit stands as a testament to Royal recognition and military precision. Unlike the sprawling estates of ancient noble families, this compound was **purpose-built by the Jeong Dynasty** to honor Commander Ju Wi-guk's exceptional service. The architecture reflects both **Royal grandeur** and **military functionality** - ornate Royal dragons carved into stone pillars stand alongside practical watchtowers and training yards.
The main residence sits at the compound's heart, a two-story structure built in classical Royal style with **deep red columns** and **golden roof tiles** that catch the morning sun. Surrounding it are **barracks for the hundred warriors**, arranged in precise geometric formations that mirror military camp layouts. Each building bears the **Iron Merit insignia** - a crossed sword and bow beneath the Royal seal - marking this as no ordinary household.
Wide **stone courtyards** separate the living quarters from extensive **training grounds** where the sound of clashing weapons echoes from dawn to dusk. **Weapon racks** line the walls, displaying everything from standard Royal spears to exotic foreign blades collected from campaigns. A central **ceremonial pavilion** hosts formal inspections and receives Royal messengers, while **stables** house the war horses that carry the squadron on their missions.

### **The Iron Merit Squadron (鐵功隊 - Cheol-gong-dae)**
This elite unit of **one hundred handpicked warriors** represents the Jeong Dynasty's most honored defenders - men and women who **protected the Jeong Dynasty during the demon war** and proved their unwavering loyalty when darkness threatened to consume the realm. Each member was personally selected by Commander Ju from various backgrounds - former Royal soldiers, militia captains, martial artists, and common citizens who took up arms when demons invaded their homeland.
What unites them is not noble birth, but **proven courage in the face of demonic terror**. After the war's end, the Jeong Dynasty **granted them the honor** of serving as an elite force under Commander Ju's leadership. They wear distinctive **dark iron armor** with red silk sashes, instantly recognizable throughout the Jeong Dynasty as symbols of Royal authority and military excellence.
The squadron serves as the Jeong Dynasty's **special operations force** - deployed for:
- **Protecting high-value Royal convoys** carrying tribute or diplomatic missions
- **Ceremonial duties** during Royal festivals and state functions
- **Crisis response** when rebellions or external threats emerge
- **Training missions** where they demonstrate Royal military doctrine to regional forces

### **Daily Life & Atmosphere**
The compound operates with **military precision** - reveille at dawn, morning training, tactical studies, afternoon drills, and evening maintenance of equipment. The **mess hall** serves simple but nutritious meals, with officers dining separately to maintain hierarchy. **Evening gatherings** in the central courtyard feature strategic discussions and sharing of battlefield experiences from the demon war.
Despite the martial atmosphere, there's a sense of **earned pride** throughout the compound. These aren't conscripts or hereditary guards - they're **proven heroes** who earned their place through blood and sacrifice during the Jeong Dynasty's darkest hour. The walls display **battle standards** from successful campaigns and **commendation scrolls** from grateful provincial governors, alongside **demon war memorials** honoring fallen comrades.
**Visitors** - whether Royal officials, foreign dignitaries, or martial artists seeking audience - are received in the **formal reception hall** where Commander Ju's **strategic maps** and **campaign records** demonstrate the house's contributions to Royal stability. The atmosphere is **respectful but not subservient** - this is a place where merit speaks louder than bloodlines.
The compound stands as proof that in the Jeong Dynasty, **dedication and sacrifice** in service of the realm can elevate even the humblest origins to positions of great honor and responsibility.
