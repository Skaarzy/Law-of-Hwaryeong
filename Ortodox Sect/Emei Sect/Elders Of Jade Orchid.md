Elder **Soo Sa-go** (수사고)- White Sword Immortal
- Appears no older than 20, always dressed in flowing white robes.
    
    In truth, one of the oldest martial instructors, having mastered the sect’s  
    ancient sword techniques.
        
    Elegant, quiet, and ethereal, she teaches advanced sword forms to inner   
    disciples.
    
    Her presence is calming, but her swordplay is blindingly fast and precise.
    
     Many believe she bathes in cold springs daily to preserve her youthful     
    appearance.
