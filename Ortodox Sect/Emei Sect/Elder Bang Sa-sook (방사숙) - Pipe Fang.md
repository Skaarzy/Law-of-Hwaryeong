**Core Power:**  
A supreme master of **mental cultivation and qi perception**, Elder Bang uses intense meditation and refined spiritual insight to perceive **the immediate future and the flow of combat** with uncanny clarity. She essentially “reads” the battlefield like an open scroll, predicting enemy movements and detecting threats before they arise.
### How it works:
- Her **cultivated qi** extends beyond herself, subtly sensing the breath, tension, and energy changes in her environment.
- She can interpret tiny shifts—heartbeat changes, muscle tension, qi fluctuations—that reveal an opponent’s intent milliseconds before movement.
- Her mind operates on multiple layers, giving her a near-future “vision” that guides her tactical decisions.
- This power grants her **extraordinary reflexes** and **strategic brilliance**, making her nearly impossible to surprise or outmaneuver.
- Her pipe and ledgers symbolize her endless study and wisdom, while her calm exterior hides a lightning-fast mind.
### Abilities:
- **Future Thread Weaving**: She mentally tracks multiple probable outcomes of any situation and acts to steer events toward the best path.
- **Battlefield Scroll**: Mentally “maps” the entire field—positions, movements, traps—and shares subtle cues with allies.
- **Qi Sense Amplification**: Heightens awareness to the point she can “feel” hostile intent or hidden enemies.
- **Moment of Clarity**: In critical moments, she slows her perception of time, allowing for instantaneous, flawless reactions.
- **Tactical Precision**: Every move she makes is the result of carefully calculated foresight; she rarely wastes energy or leaves openings.
### Personality & Role:
- The ultimate strategist and guardian behind the scenes.
- Stoic and calm, always observing and analyzing.
- Commands respect through wisdom rather than physical might.
- Often seen quietly smoking her pipe, lost in thought, while her mind races ahead.
- Mastermind who keeps the sect stable and prepares it for unseen dangers.
