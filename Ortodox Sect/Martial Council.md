After the eternal war a first Martial alliance was made, called [The Martial Court] . it was made just for the ruling of what to do with the heavenly demon who didn't surrender himself but his location was know and he wasn't hiding , all of the surviving sect masters and elders gathered together along with the heads of each of the 5 clans and the Royal court officials who came to one place the place where it all began at the now rebuilt but a part left intentionally burnt so its never forgotten and the grave that is place next to it of The falling petal immortal ,the plum blossom retreat, as ideas came to what to do with the heavenly demon the Royal court voted to kill him and burn him at stake ,some clan heads agreed with the Jeong Dynasty some said its unnecessary to kill him as its was the Jeong Dynasty that caused his creation , and the majority which was the sects most with a few who supported the Jeong Dynasty agreed on imprisonment and so it was decide that the orthodox sects will handle it by sending two squads each made of their best and most powerful to go defeat and subdue the heavenly demon, and so it happened with the heavenly demon putting little resistance and even laughing for the first time ,it was clear he was enjoying the fighting but after a short battle he was subdued with most of the sect masters and warriors thinking he could have killed them all if he wanted but nonetheless he gave up and was chained and put inside his very throne room he once gave orders from now kneeling and visibly weakened as he wasn't getting any blood so his qi was drained and all that was left was his frail body, heavenly demon now becoming a simple human with no qi in his blood .A man dying of thirst getting just one drop of water daily .And is still being guarded by hundreds of the [[Serene Mountain Sect]] warriors who took over the province of the [[Heavenly Root Sect]] was banished and most of them got killed of, the [[Serene Mountain Sect]] guarding Heavenly demon diligently and letting only certain high-ranking sect members or people who have been approved being allowed to visit him .After his imprisonment the martial court was disbanded as the divide between the sects and the Jeong Dynasty grew wider to the point of the sects separation.


Years and years after a new council was made by the sects with the same name and a similar purpose but this time it was only the sect leaders that where in it and it served as a stepping stone for the sects to unite and give each other guidance and any type of aid necessary after the separation from the Jeong Dynasty and the clans, took a toll on the sects economy the aftermath of the demon war was wearing the sects out over time and they needed  to act and make a choice, thus the leaders met for the first time to find solutions of how to help the sects get back on their feet ,  the meeting went somewhat chaotic but still some options and choices where laid out and at the ending of the meeting the Beggars Sect leader suggested that they continue to meet until all sects become more stable as it would be easier if everybody knew each sects situation and what the needed aid for, thus the second marital alliance became a thing now named [The Martial Council] instead of court as the goal was help and not prosecuting others.This Councils Leader and the one who had final word was decide to be the leader of the ruling sect based on power, so the longest sects leader was the Council Leader as well and nobody had a issue with this as the sect was prospering, so [[Baek Chun (백천) (Supreme Sword Emperor)]] became the Leader of The Martial Council, as heavenly sword sect was the only one barely standing and was somewhat advanced ,


The location this time is discrete yet calm a small hut in the coast town of the heavenly sword sect province and only those who attend know its location as its a house of a simple resident of that town who lends it to the sect as a simple resort for ordinary warriors once a year while they travel ,which is a cover as those warriors then clean and prepare the house as well as scout for any weird stuff happening only after all that is the marital council date set
