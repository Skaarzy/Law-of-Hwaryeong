Sect master : [[Lee Gan-jun (이간준)- The Crane Behind the Curtain]]
Location : inside the Jeong Dynasty province

**Hangul:** 천문파 (Cheon-mun-pa)  
**Hanja:** 天門派 – _天_ (Cheon) = Celestial / _門_ (Mun) = Gate / _派_ (Pa) = Sect

Lee Gan-jun is a cunning, charming, and ruthless man with a flawless reputation in court. His gentle voice masks razor-sharp calculation. As a high official in the Royal court, he controls channels of information across the Jeong Dynasty. No one knows how far his reach extends and he was never seen using a weapon, and only that by the time you realize he's involved, it's already far too late because he shifted the battle to his favor.
The sect he created is an elite and secretive sect that only accepts the children or family members of nobles, high officials, and powerful families. They are an orthodox sect praised for their elegance, discipline, and intellect.
The Celestial Gate exists in a grey zone—neither fully a traditional murim sect nor purely Royal guards. They occupy both worlds simultaneously, blurring the line between martial artist and soldier, cultivator and enforcer. To the jianghu, they are an orthodox sect with all the prestige that entails. To the Jeong Dynasty, they are an elite military force with authority that transcends normal command structures. This duality makes them uniquely powerful and deeply unsettling to both worlds.
However, many major orthodox sects do not respect or trust them. Their deep ties to the Jeong Dynasty raise suspicions that they are nothing more than Royal lapdogs, controlled by political masters rather than martial principles. These sects question whether the Celestial Gate truly follows the path of a cultivator or merely serves as the Jeong Dynasty's fist dressed in robes. The accusation lingers in whispers at sect gatherings: they have traded their independence for Royal favor, making them cultivators in name only.
As the only sect based in the Royal province and directly backed by the Jeong Dynasty itself, the Celestial Gate Sect serves as the iron fist of Royal authority. They are the Jeong Dynasty's enforcers—guardians of its cities, villages, and borders. Their purpose is rooted in protection of the Jeong Dynasty above all else.
But protection comes with a price. The sect operates with brutal efficiency, wielding their authority publicly and without shame. They exploit legal loopholes, fabricate charges, and twist Royal law to their advantage. Common folk and the poor suffer under their "justice," but as long as the Jeong Dynasty prospers and order is maintained, no action is too heavy-handed. They are both shield and executioner, operating within the letter of the law while trampling its spirit.
The Celestial Gate's martial arts are rooted in a unique fusion—Royal military fighting styles enhanced with qi cultivation. Where common soldiers rely on discipline and formation, the sect's disciples channel internal energy through these same proven techniques, transforming standard military forms into something far more lethal. Their style is both familiar and alien: the stances are recognizable, the movements precise and efficient, but amplified to superhuman levels through qi mastery. This makes them uniquely dangerous—opponents expect Royal guards, but face cultivators with the ruthless efficiency of war-tested combat arts.
The sect rose to prominence when its master became a major figure in the Heavenly Pavilion, the Jeong Dynasty's most sacred and powerful administrative body. Through this position, he embedded the sect deep into Royal infrastructure, using secrets and influence to elevate the sect into an officially recognized orthodox group.
From there, the Celestial Gate became inseparable from the Jeong Dynasty itself—its disciples serving as magistrates, border commanders, and enforcers. They act as the sword that falls when Royal will is questioned, ensuring loyalty through fear as much as law.

Their survival depends on maintaining a delicate balance:
- **To the Jeong Dynasty:** they must show absolute loyalty, proving they’re useful tools rather than dangerous independents. If the emperor or court thinks they’re growing too autonomous, they could be dismantled overnight.
- **To the Ortodox:** they must wear the mask of an orthodox sect, showing enough elegance, discipline, and “cultivator spirit” that they aren’t dismissed as mere soldiers or lapdogs. They can’t fully break with martial society, or they’ll lose legitimacy.
- **Internally:** they must manage recruits from noble families, keeping them disciplined while also ensuring those families feel represented. Too much favoritism weakens the sect, too much strictness risks alienating their backers.
