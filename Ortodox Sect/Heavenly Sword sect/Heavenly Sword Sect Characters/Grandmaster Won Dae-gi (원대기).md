**Grandmaster Won Dae-gi (원대기) – Wandering Ash**
An old man in dirt-caked robes, with wild, matted hair and a beard that seems untouched by a comb in decades. Blind, with a long scar across his left eye, he walks with unshakable confidence and rarely stumbles. He carries a rusted, absurdly long katana that looks like it was pulled from a grave—but it is said he could defeat a master even with a mere twig.
Won Dae-gi lives as a wanderer rather than a Grandmaster, roaming mountains and villages, often visiting sect branches unannounced. He is known for his laughter, strange tales, and meddling in mundane affairs purely for amusement. Many disciples meet him without realizing his identity until he vanishes, leaving only cryptic advice.
Extroverted, unpredictable, and unorthodox, his chaotic presence belies piercing wisdom. He does not seek ultimate power or dominance, despite being one of the most formidable swordsmen alive. His swordsmanship is wild and unconventional, sometimes involving throwing his katana with devastating precision. Though some whisper that his methods disgrace the sect and the Way of the Sword, no one dares challenge him openly—his actual power is unquestionable.
Though he and Sim Eon-gun trained under the same master, their paths diverged completely, making them philosophical and practical opposites. Where Eon-gun is precision, control, and formality, Won Dae-gi is instinct, chaos, and raw adaptability—a living embodiment of unpredictability in the Plum Blossom Sect.
