Mun Tae-min is the rightful and respected head of the **Plum Blossom Sect**, chosen not by ambition or conflict, but through **lineage and merit**. As the next in line for succession, he accepted leadership with solemnity and responsibility, becoming the seventh wielder of the **Plum Blossom Sword**, the sect’s most sacred relic. Though his rise was expected, few anticipated the power and clarity he would bring to the role.
From a young age, Mun Tae-min demonstrated exceptional talent with the sword and with medicine his techniques were not only precise but unnervingly calm. His instructors said he never fought _to win_—he fought to calm himself. Inheriting the sect's leadership only deepened his focus on the perfection of form, balance, and execution. Where others sought fame or disciples, he sought stillness, clarity, and silence in every movement.
Mun Tae-min is a **cold, reserved figure**, rarely displaying emotion and always looking fatigued. He does not scold, flatter, or debate. He leads through example utter control, flawless technique, and a presence that compels discipline. Despite his distant nature, he is admired and feared, even by other sect leaders. He does not seek approval. He commands it.He is tall, slim, and ghost-pale, with flowing black hair and white eyes that give the impression of blindness though no one doubts his vision on or off the battlefield. His robes are some what bleak and murky as he doesnt care about fashion or what he wear, and he moves with such quiet grace its as plum blossom grows underneath his feet.
His sword, the **Plum Blossom Sword**, is a masterpiece of balance and tradition. Each sect leader before him has added something to the blade not physically, but spiritually refining its technique through their mastery. Mun Tae-min is said to be the greatest among them. He has achieved a level of swordsmanship and healing that seems effortless, as if the blade itself moves with intention and his skill medicine needles find acupoints with ease.
His signature technique, **Falling Petals, Eternal Stillness** (落英无声),and **spring body** is a testament to his philosophy: beauty in control, death without excess. With a single unsheathing, he releases petal-like arcs of energy that drift quietly toward their targets.He only uses it in dire situations and when he gets angry , the technique transforms his whole sword qi , as it almost looks like its heating up the bland green qi starts turning a amber pink closer to red color making it look like the sword has just come out a forge furnace but its not hot at all it almost gets colder as it resemble the plum blossom blooming in winter, with this so do his eye turn the same color like his anger start burning inside him.
Though he played a critical role in the **Eternal War**, Mun Tae-min did not march with armies. He searched for the one who killed the Falling Petal immortal, did not care about others provinces or situations just where the killer of his master was, once he killed the killer he left without word. He is not a war hero. He is a necessary force.
Today, Mun Tae-min is the spiritual and martial pillar of the Plum Blossom Sect. He teaches rarely, selects no disciples publicly, and has no interest in fame. He is a master not just of the sword, but of restraint—the embodiment of the sword that strikes only when all else has failed.
When he moves, the wind quiets. When he speaks, silence falls. When he draws his blade, it is plum blossoms.In the early parts of the eternal war he was a member of the Royal council but after one of the sect branches was attacked he went into seclusion because he felt guilty that he couldn't protect it,and after a couple of year he emerged as a powerful beast , no one was near his level of power.While he was in seclusion his son [[Mun Sang-woo (문상우)]] was the leader of the sect and held the sect and its land/people safe.
