**Name:** Jang Mun-so  
**Nickname:** The Falling Petal Immortal

An old man with flowing white hair and a long white beard. His layered robes are worn and messy, draping off his shoulders like an old scroll left out in the wind. He walks slowly, often leaning on a crooked wooden cane that seems older than he is, and always carries a calm, amused smile as if he’s gently mocking the world. Despite his frail appearance, there’s a serene, almost divine air to him. When he speaks, his voice feels like the last wind before snow falls.
Weapon None. He abandoned the sword long ago, claiming “the blade feels heavy when one’s heart grows.” Instead, he uses his cane and precise internal energy to redirect force, slice wind, or even deflect attacks with gestures and sleeves alone as his mastery is in the plum blossom arts which can negate any attack no matter the power , but none in the sect learned it except him who is said to transcend to another being , its also the reason that he has no use for a weapon.
Fighting Style: His style is purely reactive, like falling petals avoiding the ground—he seems to never attack first, and never gets hit always making his opponents tire out or give up. He can disable enemies with one step or redirect a killing strike into silence. Many claim he can erase a person’s intent to fight rather than defeat them physically.Yet after he transcended he went into seclusion that turned out to be now his permanent location as he doesn't want nor need to move around the world now all he seeks is peace and calm , this location is on top of the Plum Blossom mountain in the deep snow where there is a hut and a single plum blossom tree in its harden that looks like its hundred of years old, there is no storage for food or water nor a furnace for fire its only him and the shabby house along with the old tree living there but he doesn't complain or need any of those things, only on some occasions he has accepted a drink if somebody else brings it.
Legacy: Once the strongest Plum Blossom Sword Master, said to have met deities and refused their help. Rather than ruling, he wandered, eventually returning only to train one last disciple—the current Plum Blossom Sword Saint.
